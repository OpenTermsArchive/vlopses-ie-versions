b. Data Security. In accordance with Article 32 GDPR, UK GDPR and LGPD, as applicable, and as described in Schedule 2 of this Agreement, Snap will implement and maintain all appropriate technical, administrative, and organizational measures required to: (i) ensure a level of confidentiality and security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of Customer Personal Data; and (ii) prevent unauthorized or unlawful processing of Customer Personal Data, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction of, or damage to, Customer Personal Data.

In the event the audit determines Snap is out of compliance with this Agreement, then Snap will be obligated for all reasonable costs of such audit.

i. Return or Destroy Customer Personal Data. Upon completion of Snap’s obligations in relation to processing of Customer Personal Data under this Agreement or upon the Data Controller’s request at any time during the term of this Agreement, (and, if the Data Controller so requests, at regular intervals set by the Data Controller), Snap will either: (i) return all or subsets of the Customer Personal Data in Snap’s possession to the Data Controller; (ii) render all or part of Customer Personal Data anonymous in such a manner that the data no longer constitutes personal data; or (iii) permanently delete or render all or parts of the Customer Personal Data unreadable.

a. Notification. In accordance with Article 33 GDPR, UK GDPR and LGPD, as applicable, Snap will notify the Data Controller without undue delay and, where feasible, no more than 72 hours after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach. Snap will also provide the Data Controller with a description of the Personal Data Breach, the type of data that was the subject of the Personal Data Breach, (to the extent known to Snap) the categories of data subjects affected, and other information required by applicable Data Protection Law, as soon as such information can be collected or otherwise becomes available, and Snap will cooperate with any reasonable request made by the Data Controller relating to the Personal Data Breach.

b. Investigation. Snap agrees to immediately take action to investigate the Personal Data Breach, to identify, prevent, and mitigate the effects of any such Personal Data Breach, and with the Data Controller’s prior agreement, to carry out any recovery or other action necessary to remedy the Personal Data Breach.

_In summary: if there is a data breach Snap will notify you within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, provide you with relevant information and will immediately take action to investigate the breach and mitigate its effects._

**5\. Subprocessors**

a. Authorized Subprocessors. The Data Controller specifically authorizes the engagement of Snap’s affiliates to process Customer Personal Data and the Data Controller generally authorizes the engagement of any other third parties as Subprocessors to process Customer Personal Data.

b. Obligations of Subprocessor. In accordance with Article 28 (4) GDPR, UK GDPR and LGPD, as applicable, Snap will impose legally binding contract terms on each Subprocessor that are as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement.

c. Restricted Access. Snap will ensure each Subprocessor only accesses and uses Customer Personal Data to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it and in accordance with this Agreement.

d. Updates of Subprocessors. In accordance with Article 28 (2) GDPR and UK GDPR (as applicable), [here](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/snap-subprocessors?language=en_US) is an up-to-date list of: (i) all Subprocessors involved in processing Customer Personal Data; (ii) the purposes for which the Subprocessors process Customer Personal Data; and (iii) the location of each Subprocessor. Snap will notify the Data Controller at least 30 days before adding a new Subprocessor. 

e. Right to Object. Data Controller has the right to object to the addition of a new Subprocessor, as described in this Section. In the event that the Data Controller objects to the processing of Customer Personal Data by any newly appointed Subprocessor, it will immediately inform Snap, after which Snap will either: (i) instruct the Subprocessor to cease any further processing of Customer Personal Data, in which event this Agreement shall continue unaffected; or (ii) allow the Data Controller to terminate this Agreement immediately.

_In summary: in addition to authorising Snap to act as a data processor, you also authorise Snap's affiliates to process customer personal data as subprocessors. Snap will enter into a legally binding agreement with all subprocessors and maintain a list of those appointed. You have the right to object to Snap's appointment of a subprocessor._

**6\. Data Transfers**

(iii) form a legally binding contract between you as the data exporter and Snap as or on behalf of the data importer; and 

(iv) be hereby incorporated into the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services). 

b. With respect to personal data of EEA, Switzerland and UK data subjects, the Data Controller and Snap agree that Snap may process Customer Personal Data outside the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK where the Data Protection Law requirements (including, where applicable, Articles 44 through 47 GDPR) are fulfilled, or an exception (including, where applicable, those listed in Article 49 GDPR) applies.

c. With respect to personal data of Brazilian data subjects, the Data Controller agrees that Snap may process Customer Personal Data outside of Brazil, and represents and warrants that such transfer of Customer Personal Data is in compliance with LGPD.

_In summary: if you are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK the Data Transfer Agreement shall apply to all transfers of personal data to Snap. With respect to personal data of EEA, Switzerland and UK data subjects, you and Snap agree to comply with the provisions relating to international transfers under the GDPR. With respect to Brazilian data subjects' personal data, you assure Snap that Snap's processing of such personal data outside Brazil will comply with the Brazilian General Data Protection Law._ 

**7\. Indemnity; Subprocessor Liability**

a. Indemnity. Snap agrees to indemnify the Data Controller against all third-party complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to Snap’s breach of this Agreement.

b. Indemnity Process. The Data Controller will promptly notify Snap in writing of any indemnification claim, but any failure to notify Snap will not relieve Snap from any indemnity liability or obligation it may have, except to the extent Snap is materially prejudiced by that failure. The Data Controller will reasonably cooperate with Snap, at Snap’s expense, in connection with the defense, compromise, or settlement of any indemnification claim. Snap will not compromise or settle any claim in any manner, nor make any admission of liability, without the Data Controller’s prior written consent, which the Data Controller may provide in its sole discretion. The Data Controller may participate (at its cost) in the defense, compromise, and settlement of the claim with counsel of the Data Controller’s choosing.

c. Subprocessor Liability. Snap acknowledges and agrees that it will remain liable to the Data Controller for a breach of the terms of this Agreement by a Subprocessor and any other subsequent third-party processors appointed by it.

_In summary: if you suffer any third party losses in relation to Snap's breach of this Agreement, Snap will compensate you._ 

**8\. Termination**

a. Termination. This Agreement will terminate automatically upon termination of the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services).

b. Survival. Snap’s obligations related to returning or deleting Customer Personal Data will survive termination of the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services) and this Agreement until Snap has returned or deleted the Customer Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement.

_In summary: this Agreement will terminate at the same time that the Business Services Terms terminate, but Snap will continue to be obliged to return or delete customer personal data._ 

**9\. Conflicts**

If there is a conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement, the [Data Transfer Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-transfer-agreement), the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services), any applicable Supplemental Terms and Policies, or the Snap [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms) the order of priority will be: the [Data Transfer Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-transfer-agreement) (but only to the extent it applies under section 6.a above), this Agreement, the Supplemental Terms and Policies, the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services), and the Snap [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms).

Implementation of and compliance with a written information security program consistent with established industry standards and including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the nature of the Customer Personal Data and designed to protect such information from: unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure; unauthorized access to or use that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the data controller, the data controller's customers, or the data controller's employees; and any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information.

2\. Adopting and implementing reasonable policies and standards related to security.

3\. Assigning responsibility for information security management.

4\. Devoting adequate personnel resources to information security.

5\. Carrying out verification checks on permanent staff who will have access to the Customer Personal Data.

6\. Conducting appropriate background checks and requiring employees, vendors, and others with access to the Customer Personal Data to enter into written confidentiality agreements.

7\. Conducting training to make employees and others with access to the Customer Personal Data aware of information security risks and to enhance compliance with Snap's policies and standards related to data protection.

8\. Preventing unauthorized access to the Customer Personal Data through the use, as appropriate, of physical and logical (passwords) entry controls, secure areas for data processing, procedures for monitoring the use of data processing facilities, built-in system audit trails, use of secure passwords, network intrusion detection technology, encryption and authentication technology, secure log-on procedures, and virus protection, monitoring compliance with Snap's policies and standards related to data protection on an ongoing basis. In particular, Snap has implemented and complies with, as appropriate and without limitation:

*   Physical access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to data processing systems (e.g., access ID cards, card readers, desk officers, alarm systems, motion detectors, burglar alarms, video surveillance, and exterior security);
    
*   Denial-of-use control measures to prevent unauthorized use of data protection systems (e.g., automatically enforced password complexity and change requirements and firewalls.);
    
*   Requirements-driven authorization scheme and access rights, and monitoring and logging of system access to ensure that persons entitled to use a data processing system have access only to the data to which they have a right of access, and that the Customer Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified, or removed without authorization;
    
*   Data transmission control measures to ensure that the Customer Personal Data cannot be read, copied, modified, or removed without authorization during electronic transmission, transport, or storage on data media, and transfer and receipt of records. In particular, Snap's information security program will be designed:
    
    *   To encrypt in storage any data sets in Snap's possession, including sensitive personal data, using appropriate encryption levels based on industry-leading encryption standards, including AES -256, and storing user identities on the system using key value pair such as ghost\_id to prevent storage of actual user ID; and
        
    *   To ensure that any sensitive personal data transmitted electronically (other than by facsimile) to a person outside Snap's IT system or transmitted over a public network is encrypted using the newest supported versions of TLS 1.2 protocol to protect the security of the transmission;
        
    
*   Data entry control measures to ensure Snap can check and establish whether and by whom the Customer Personal Data has been input into data processing systems, modified, or removed;
    
*   Continuous security testing measures to ensure information security practices remain relevant, effective, and up to date, including annual penetration testings, bug bounty program, use of system scanning tools, tabletop exercises, backup restoration tests, pre-production failovers, and conducting post-mortems on any actual incidents in order to update the relevant disaster recovery plans;
    
*   Subprocessor supervision measures to ensure that, if Snap is permitted to use subprocessors, the Customer Personal Data is processed strictly in accordance with the data controller's instructions including, as appropriate:
    
    *   Measures to ensure that the Customer Personal Data is protected from accidental destruction or loss including, as appropriate and without limitation, data backup, retention and secure destruction policies; secure offsite storage of data sufficient for disaster recovery; uninterrupted power supply, and disaster recovery programs; and
        
    *   Measures to ensure that data collected for different purposes can be processed separately including, as appropriate, physical or adequate logical separation of Customer Personal Data. 
        
    

9\. Taking such other steps as may be appropriate under the circumstances.

Data Transfer Agreement


---------------------------

Effective: July 25, 2023

PLEASE NOTE: WE'VE PUBLISHED THE TERMS BELOW IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE 2022 UK APPROVED ADDENDUM TO THE 2021 EUROPEAN COMMISSION-APPROVED STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES AND TO CLARIFY SUCH 2021 EC-APPROVED SCCS APPLY TO TRANSFERS OF SWISS CUSTOMER PERSONAL DATA.

**Introduction** 

This Data Transfer Agreement (“DTA”) forms a legally binding contract between you and Snap, and applies to any transfer subject to Data Protection Law of Customer Personal Data from you to Snap outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, and is incorporated into the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-processing-agreement) and [Data Sharing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-sharing-agreement), as applicable. Some terms used in this DTA are defined in those agreements.

**1\. Definitions**

"Data Transfer" means a processing activity whereby Customer Personal Data which is processed in accordance with Data Protection Law is transferred from you to Snap (or our premises) in a third country other than the EEA, UK, Switzerland or a country subject to an adequacy decision made by the European Commission or UK Secretary of State (as applicable) in accordance with the relevant provisions of applicable Data Protection Law. 

"SCCs" means the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission in Commission Decision 2021/914 dated 4 June 2021, for transfers of personal data in countries not otherwise recognised as offering an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission (as amended and updated from time to time).

"UK IDTA Addendum" means the Mandatory Clauses of Addendum B.1.0 issued by the ICO and laid before Parliament in accordance with s119A of the Data Protection Act 2018 on 2 February 2022, as it is revised under Section ‎‎18 of those Mandatory Clauses.

The terms “personal data”, “data subject”, “processing”, “controller”, ”processor”, “representative” and “supervisory authority” shall have the meanings given in the GDPR or UK GDPR, as applicable, in each case irrespective of whether Data Protection Law applies. In addition, some terms used in this DTA are defined in the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services).

**2\. Controller to controller Data Transfers**

a. _EEA / Swiss Data:_ Where a Data Transfer occurs for which you are acting as a data controller and share Customer Personal Data of EEA or Swiss data subjects with Snap as a data controller under the [Data Sharing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-sharing-agreement), then: (i) any Data Transfers that occur of such data shall be governed by the [EEA controller to controller SCCs](https://www.snap.com/terms/eea-c-c-scc), which are incorporated into this DTA; and (ii) Annexes I and II of those SCCs shall be completed with the information set out in Schedules 1 and 2 of the [Data Sharing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-sharing-agreement), respectively.

b. _UK Data:_ Where a Data Transfer occurs for which you are acting as a data controller and share Customer Personal Data of UK data subjects with Snap as a data controller under the [Data Sharing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-sharing-agreement), then any Data Transfers that occur of such data shall be governed by the [EEA controller to controller SCCs](https://www.snap.com/terms/eea-c-c-scc) incorporating the amendments set out in clause 2.a. and the UK IDTA Addendum.

**3\. Controller to processor Data Transfers**

a. _EEA / Swiss Data:_ Where a Data Transfer occurs for which you are acting as data controller and provide Customer Personal Data of EEA or Swiss data subjects to Snap as a processor under the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-processing-agreement), then any Data Transfers that occur of such data shall be governed by the [EEA controller to processor SCCs](https://www.snap.com/terms/standard-contractual-clauses) which are incorporated into this DTA with the following amendments (with references in this clause 3 to Clauses being to Clauses of the SCCs): (i) in respect of Clause 9 (sub-processors), Snap shall inform you of intended changes by updating the list available [here](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/snap-subprocessors?language=en_US); and (ii) Annexes I and II of the [EEA controller to processor SCCs](https://www.snap.com/terms/standard-contractual-clauses) shall be completed with the information set out in Schedules 1 and 2 of the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-processing-agreement), respectively.

b. _UK Data:_ Where a Data Transfer occurs for which you are acting as a data controller and provide Customer Personal Data of UK data subjects to Snap acting as a processor under the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-processing-agreement), then any Data Transfers which occur of such data shall be governed by the [EEA controller to processor SCCs](https://www.snap.com/terms/standard-contractual-clauses) incorporating the amendments set out in clause 3.a. and the UK IDTA Addendum. 

**4\. Supplementary Measures** 

In respect of any Data Transfers, the following supplementary measures shall apply:

a. Snap represents and warrants that, at the time of the transfer, it has not received any formal legal requests from any government intelligence or security service/agencies in the country to which the relevant Customer Personal Data is being exported, for access to (or for copies of) Customer Personal Data that has been transferred to Snap pursuant to this Agreement ("Government Agency Requests"); and

b. if, during the term of this DTA, Snap receives any Government Agency Requests, it will (unless prohibited by Applicable Law from doing so) inform you in writing as soon as reasonably practicable and you and Snap shall (as soon as reasonably practicable) discuss and determine whether all or any transfers of Customer Personal Data pursuant to this Agreement should be suspended in the light of such Government Agency Requests.

**5\. Further Assurance**

a. If Data Protection Law requires you to execute the SCCs or UK IDTA Addendum applicable to a particular transfer of Customer Personal Data to Snap as a separate agreement, then Snap shall, on your request, promptly execute such SCCs or UK IDTA Addendum incorporating such amendments as may reasonably be required by you to reflect the applicable clauses, Schedules and Annexes of this DTA, the details of the transfer and the requirements of the relevant Data Protection Law. 

b. If either: (i) any of the means of legitimising transfers of personal data outside of the EEA countries, Switzerland or UK which are referred to in this DTA cease to be valid; or (ii) any supervisory authority requires transfers of Personal Data pursuant to those means to be suspended, then Snap may by notice to the other party, with effect from the date set out in such notice, amend or put in place alternative arrangements in respect of such transfers, as required by the relevant Data Protection Law.

**6\. Conflicts**

If there is any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this DTA and any other applicable agreement, the order of precedence shall be as follows: the UK IDTA Addendum and the relevant SCCs (as applicable), this DTA, the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-processing-agreement) or [Data Sharing Agreement](https://www.snap.com/terms/data-sharing-agreement) (as applicable), and the [Business Service Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services).

_In summary: this Agreement applies to any transfer of customer personal data from you to Snap outside of the EEA, Switzerland, the UK, or a country subject to an adequacy decision made by the European Commission or UK Secretary of State (as applicable). Different transfer mechanisms apply depending on the customers' country of residence and whether the data is being shared with Snap as a data controller or as a data processor. Snap promises that at the time of any data transfer it has not received any Government Agency Requests for the data and that Snap will inform you of any such requests as soon as reasonably practicable. If Data Protection Laws require the execution of separate transfer mechanisms, then Snap will assist with putting these in place. If the transfer mechanisms set out above become invalid or are otherwise suspended by a regulator, Snap may amend or put in place alternative transfer mechanisms._
