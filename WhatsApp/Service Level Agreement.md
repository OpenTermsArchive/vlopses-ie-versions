European Electronic Communications Code Notice
==============================================

Last modified: November 23, 2021

The European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972) (the "**EECC**") requires us to provide applicable users of WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business App, and WhatsApp Business API with the following information about the electronic communication service that we provide as part of our Services or Business Services. This information supplements the terms of service for those services. Applicable users include microenterprises or small enterprises or not-for-profit organisations, unless they have explicitly agreed to waive all or parts of those provisions. For the purposes of your documentation, future reference and unchanged reproduction, you may download or print a copy of this document.

### Quality Of Service

We work hard to provide the best service we can. However we cannot guarantee any minimum levels of quality of service and make no guarantees that our Services or Business Services will always function without disruptions, delay or errors. A number of factors beyond WhatsApp's control may also impact your experience in using our Services or Business Services and may result in the disruption of your communication with other users including but not limited to: your local network, firewall, your internet service provider, the public internet, and power supply.

### Security

We work to protect the safety, security, and integrity of WhatsApp by appropriately dealing with abusive people and activity violating our terms of service. We work to prohibit misuse of our Services and Business Services including harmful conduct towards others. We operate systems to improve our ability to detect incidents, threats or vulnerabilities that may harm the security of our Services and Business Services. If we learn of activity like this, we will take appropriate action such as removing that activity or contacting law enforcement.

### Price

We do not charge for using the WhatsApp Messenger or the WhatsApp Business App, unless we agree otherwise with you. If you use the WhatsApp Business API a charge may apply, and is specified in the agreement between you and Facebook. All users of our Services and Business Services are responsible for carrier data plans, Internet access fees, and other fees and taxes associated with use of our Services or Business Services.

### Duration, Renewal And Termination

WhatsApp Messenger and WhatsApp Business App users can terminate their relationship with WhatsApp at any time for any reason by deleting their account. WhatsApp Business API users can terminate the use of Business Services in accordance with the terms of their agreement with Facebook. For all users, we may modify, suspend or terminate your access to or use of our Services or Business Services for the reasons described in your terms of service, or the terms of your agreement with Facebook, as applicable.

There are important differences between our Services or Business Services and your mobile phone and a fixed-line telephone and SMS services. Our Services and Business Services do not provide access to emergency services or emergency services providers, including the police, fire departments, or hospitals, or otherwise connect to public safety answering points. You should ensure you can contact your relevant emergency services providers through a mobile phone, a fixed-line telephone, or other service.

### Data You Provide

You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account. If you don't provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use WhatsApp. Business users must create a WhatsApp business account by providing accurate, current, and complete information, including the business user's valid legal business phone number, company name, and other information we require.
