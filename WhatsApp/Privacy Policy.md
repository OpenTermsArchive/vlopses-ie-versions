_If you live in the [UK](https://faq.whatsapp.com/523679699550284/), WhatsApp LLC provides the Services to you under this [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-uk) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy-uk)._

### WhatsApp Legal Info

If you live outside the [European Region](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1013614932324960/) or the [UK](https://faq.whatsapp.com/523679699550284/), WhatsApp LLC ("WhatsApp," "our," "we," or "us") provides our Services to you under this [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Our Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") helps explain our data practices, including the information we process to provide our Services.

For example, our Privacy Policy talks about what information we collect and how this affects you. It also explains the steps we take to protect your privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren’t stored by us and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.

We are one of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). You can learn more further below in this Privacy Policy about the ways in which we share information across this family of companies.

This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.

Please also read WhatsApp’s [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) ("Terms"), which describe the terms under which you use and we provide our Services.

### Key Updates

Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy) you’ll find:

*   **Additional Information On How We Handle Your Data**. Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy provide more information on how we process your data, and our commitment to privacy. For example, we’ve added more information about more recent product features and functionalities, how we process your data for safety, security, and integrity, and added more direct links to user settings, Help Center articles and how you can manage your information.
*   **Better Communication With Businesses**. Many businesses rely on WhatsApp to communicate with their customers and clients. We work with businesses that use Meta or third parties to help store and better manage their communications with you on WhatsApp.
*   **Making It Easier To Connect**. As part of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), WhatsApp partners with Meta to offer experiences and integrations across Meta’s family of apps and products.

### Information We Collect

WhatsApp must receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.

The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.

Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your location with your contacts if you do not permit us to collect your location data from your device. Permissions can be managed through your Settings menu on both Android and iOS devices.

#### Information You Provide

*   **Your Account Information**. You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account. If you don’t provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and "about" information.

*   **Your Messages**. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them:
    *   **Undelivered Messages**. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.
    *   **Media Forwarding**. When a user forwards media within a message, we store that media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.  
          
        We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them. Learn more about [end-to-end encryption](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption) and [how businesses communicate with you on WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption-for-business-messages).
*   **Your Connections**. You can use the contact upload feature and provide us, if permitted by applicable laws, with the phone numbers in your address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information for you in a way that ensures those contacts cannot be identified by us. Learn more about our contact upload feature [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/contacts/about-contact-upload). You can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information. You give your groups a name. You can provide a group profile picture or description.
*   **Status Information**. You may provide us your status if you choose to include one on your account. Learn how to use status on [Android](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/status/how-to-use-status), [iPhone](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/status/how-to-use-status), or [KaiOS](https://faq.whatsapp.com/339368650376736/).
*   **Transactions And Payments Data**. If you use our payments services, or use our Services meant for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). If you use our payments services available in your country or territory, our privacy practices are described in the applicable payments privacy policy.
*   **Customer Support And Other Communications**. When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues.

  

#### Automatically Collected Information

*   **Usage And Log Information**. We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you [interact with others](https://faq.whatsapp.com/9658856237523915) using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, "about" information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your "last seen"); and when you last updated your "about" information.
*   **Device And Connection Information**. We collect device and connection-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information (including phone number, mobile operator or ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information, and identifiers (including identifiers unique to [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) associated with the same device or account).
*   **Location Information**. We collect and use precise location information from your device with your permission when you choose to use [location-related features](https://faq.whatsapp.com/675327250630399), like when you decide to share your location with your contacts or view locations nearby or locations others have shared with you. There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country). We also use your location information for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.
*   **Cookies**. We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize them. For example, we use cookies to provide our Services for web and desktop and other web-based services. We may also use cookies to understand which of our Help Center articles are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customize our Services for you. [Learn more](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/cookies) about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.

  

### Third-Party Information

*   **Information Others Provide About You**. We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (like information from their mobile address book) just as you may provide theirs. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.  
    You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.  
    
*   **User Reports**. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is made, we collect information on both the reporting user and reported user. To find out more about what happens when a user report is made, please see [Advanced Safety and Security Features](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/staying-safe-on-whatsapp).
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**. Businesses you interact with using our Services may provide us with information about their interactions with you. We require each of these businesses to act in accordance with applicable law when providing any information to us.  
    When you message with a business on WhatsApp, keep in mind that the content you share may be visible to several people in that business. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Meta) to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service provider access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties or Meta, you should review that business’ privacy policy or contact the business directly.  
    
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with them to distribute our apps; provide our technical and physical infrastructure, delivery, and other systems; provide engineering support, cybersecurity support, and operational support; supply location, map, and places information; process payments; help us understand how people use our Services; market our Services; help you connect with businesses using our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; ensure safety, security, and integrity; and help with customer service. These companies may provide us with information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us with reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.  
    The "[How We Work With Other Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-other-meta-companies)" section below provides more information about how WhatsApp collects and shares information with the other [Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-other-meta-companies).  
    
*   **Third-Party Services**. We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). If you use our Services with such third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

### How We Use Information

We use information we have (subject to choices you make and applicable law) to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. Here's how:

*   **Our Services**. We use information we have to operate and provide our Services, including providing customer support; completing purchases or transactions; improving, fixing, and customizing our Services; and connecting our Services with [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) that you may use. We also use information we have to understand how people use our Services; evaluate and improve our Services; research, develop, and test new services and features; and conduct troubleshooting activities. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
*   **Safety, Security, And Integrity**. Safety, security, and integrity are an integral part of our Services. We use information we have to verify accounts and activity; combat harmful conduct; protect users against bad experiences and spam; and promote safety, security, and integrity on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms and policies, and to ensure our Services are being used legally. Please see the [Law, Our Rights and Protection](#privacy-policy-law-our-rights-and-protection) section below for more information.
*   **Communications About Our Services And** [**The Meta Companies**](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). We use information we have to communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our terms, policies, and other important updates. We may provide you marketing for our Services and those of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies).

*   **No Third-Party Banner Ads**. We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our Services. We have no intention to introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this Privacy Policy.

*   **Business Interactions**. We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as [Catalogs](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-catalog) for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.

### Information You And We Share

You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.

*   **Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate**. You share your information (including messages) as you use and communicate through our Services.
*   **Information Associated With Your Account**. Your phone number, profile name and photo, "about" information, last seen information, and message receipts are available to anyone who uses our Services, although you can configure your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users, including businesses, with whom you communicate.
*   **Your Contacts And Others**. Users, including businesses, with whom you communicate can store or reshare your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services. You can use your Services settings and the “block” feature in our Services to manage who you communicate with on our Services and certain information you share.
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**. We offer specific services to businesses such as providing them with metrics regarding their use of our Services.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. We work with these companies to support our Services, such as to provide technical infrastructure, delivery and other systems; market our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; protect the safety, security, and integrity of users and others; and assist with customer service. When we share information with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.
*   **Third-Party Services**. When you or others use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another [Meta Company Product](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or [Meta Company Product](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). Please note that when you use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

### How We Work With Other Meta Companies

As part of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information (see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-information-does-whatsapp-share-with-the-facebook-companies)) with, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings, including the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). This includes:

*   helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems;
*   understanding how our Services or theirs are used;
*   promoting safety, security, and integrity across the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), e.g., securing systems and fighting spam, threats, abuse, or infringement activities;
*   improving their services and your experiences using them, such as making suggestions for you (for example, of friends or group connections, or of interesting content), personalizing features and content, helping you complete purchases and transactions, and showing relevant offers and ads across the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products); and
*   providing integrations which enable you to connect your WhatsApp experiences with other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). For example, allowing you to connect your Facebook Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp or enabling you to chat with your friends on other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), such as Portal, by connecting your WhatsApp account.

Learn more about the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) and their privacy practices by reviewing their privacy policies.

### Assignment, Change Of Control, And Transfer

In the event that we are involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring, bankruptcy, or sale of all or some of our assets, we will share your information with the successor entities or new owners in connection with the transaction in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

### Managing And Retaining Your Information

You can access or port your information using our in-app Request Account Info feature (available under Settings > Account). For iPhone users, you can learn how to [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-request-your-account-information), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-edit-your-profile), and [delete](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account) your information through our [iPhone Help Center articles](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/). For Android users, you can learn how to [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-request-your-account-information), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-edit-your-profile), and [delete](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account) your information through our [Android Help Center articles](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/).

We store information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, including to provide our Services or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations.

If you would like to further manage, change, limit, or delete your information, you can do that through the following tools:

*   **Services Settings**. You can change your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users. You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our “block” feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.
*   **Changing Your Mobile Phone Number, Profile Name And Picture, And “About” Information**. If you change your mobile phone number, you must update it using our in-app change number feature and transfer your account to your new mobile phone number. You can also change your profile name, profile picture, and "about" information at any time.
*   **Deleting Your WhatsApp Account**. You can delete your WhatsApp account at any time (including if you want to revoke your consent to our use of your information pursuant to applicable law) using our in-app delete my account feature. When you delete your WhatsApp account, your undelivered messages are deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer need to operate and provide our Services. Deleting your account will, for example, delete your account info and profile photo, delete you from all WhatsApp groups, and delete your WhatsApp message history. Be mindful that if you only delete WhatsApp from your device without using our in-app delete my account feature, your information will be stored with us for a longer period. Please remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect your information related to the groups you created or the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you sent them.

You can learn more [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account/) about our data deletion and retention practices and about how to delete your account.

### Law, Our Rights, And Protection

We access, preserve, and share your information described in the "[Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect)" section of this Privacy Policy above if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: (a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, legal process, or government requests; (b) enforce our Terms and any other applicable terms and policies, including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, or address fraud and other illegal activity or security, and technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, WhatsApp, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

### Our Global Operations

WhatsApp shares information globally, both internally within the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) and externally with our partners and service providers, and with those with whom you communicate around the world, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States; countries or territories where the [Meta Companies’](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) affiliates and partners, or our service providers are located; or any other country or territory globally where our Services are provided outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. WhatsApp uses Meta’s global infrastructure and data centers, including in the United States. These transfers are necessary to provide the global Services set forth in our Terms. Please keep in mind that the countries or territories to which your information is transferred may have different privacy laws and protections than what you have in your home country or territory.

### Updates To Our Policy

We may amend or update our Privacy Policy. We will provide you notice of amendments to this Privacy Policy, as appropriate, and update the “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy from time to time.

[](#)WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy
=====================================

Effective May 1, 2021

Table of Contents

*   [Information We Collect](#0aqW3FbhwNCFlGqsv)
*   [How We Use Information](#1snYU3gajAZI4IxDV)
*   [Information You And We Share](#2WkMVB1lqU3eg2SR1)
*   [Managing your Information](#3sDt1Jbzd4Vi2kCua)
*   [Updates To Our Policy](#4ZVrcDmJHiql2dOvm)

This WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy helps explain our information practices when you use our Services or Business Services, which include the ability to send and receive payments (“Payments”) through the use of [Facebook Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) and the payment services provided by third-party financial institutions (“FIs”). When we say “WhatsApp”, “our”, “we” or “us”, we’re talking about WhatsApp LLC.

Payments contains links to or integrations with FIs and with [Facebook Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). When you interact with these FIs or Facebook Companies, you may be providing information directly to them, to WhatsApp, or to both. These FIs and Facebook Companies will have their own policies describing the collection, use, and disclosure of information by them. We encourage you to review the policies of these FIs and Facebook Companies.

This WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy supplements (i) WhatsApp’s general [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#privacy-policy) (“WhatsApp Privacy Policy”), which applies to the use of all our Services, including Payments, and (ii) the data practices set forth in our [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms/) (“WhatsApp Business Terms”), which apply to the use of our Business Services, including Payments. If there is any conflict between this WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy and our WhatsApp Privacy Policy or the WhatsApp Business Terms, this WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy will control solely with respect to your use of Payments and only to the extent of the conflict.

Please also see WhatsApp’s general [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#terms-of-service) (“WhatsApp Terms”), which describe the terms under which you use our Services and also apply to Payments, as well as our WhatsApp Business Terms, which describe the terms under which you use our Business Services. The WhatsApp [Payments Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#payments) (“WhatsApp Payments Terms”) supplement the WhatsApp Terms and WhatsApp Business Terms, govern your use of Payments, and describe Payments in more detail.

Please read all of these documents carefully.

### Information We Collect

We receive the following additional information related to your use of Payments.

#### Information You Provide

*   **Registration and Setup Information**. When you register to use Payments, we require you to provide information about your payment method, security preferences, and other information that identifies you. If you choose to do so, you may set up and use the security features provided by your device’s operating system to authorize a payment. Before allowing you to send funds, you may be asked to demonstrate that you are authorized to use your payment method by providing us a one-time password, deposit information, or other identifying information.
*   **Payment Transaction Information**. When you send, receive, or request payments, you provide us with the information and details related to the transaction (including your payment method, payment amount, and security credential such as a PIN). WhatsApp messages sent with payments are delivered once the transaction has processed or when the receiver has reached a transaction limit and are treated as described in our WhatsApp Privacy Policy or WhatsApp Business Terms, as applicable.

#### Information Others Provide About You

*   **Other Users and Businesses**. We receive information about you from other users and businesses. For example, when other users or businesses you know use our Services or Business Services, they may provide information about their transactions with you, just as you may provide information to us about your transactions with them. We require each of these users and businesses to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with service providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market Payments; provide customer support; and keep our system safe and secure. These companies may provide us information about you or your Payments activity; for example, customer support service agents may relay information that you provide while resolving an issue with Payments.
*   **Third-Party Financial Institutions and Facebook Companies**. We enable Payments by working with FIs and Facebook Companies to facilitate the movement of funds between the sender and receiver. When you use Payments, these FIs or Facebook Companies share with us information about you or your Payments activity in accordance with applicable law.

Adding your WhatsApp account to an Accounts Centre
==================================================

What is WhatsApp in Accounts Centre
-----------------------------------

[Accounts Centre](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/accounts-center/) is a place where you can centrally manage account settings and connected experiences across your Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Meta accounts. Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre is completely optional. You can add and remove your WhatsApp account to and from Accounts Centre at any time.

By adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre, you'll unlock experiences that work across Meta apps, such as the ability to easily share your Status created on WhatsApp to Stories on Facebook or Instagram. You'll also be able to manage some account settings in one place, such as adjusting profile information. Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre means WhatsApp and Meta will share information to provide these benefits, which we explain below and in the [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre does not affect the privacy of your WhatsApp personal messages or calls, which will remain end-to-end encrypted. No one else, not even WhatsApp or Meta, can read or listen to them. We also do not share your contact lists with any other [Meta Company](https://faq.whatsapp.com/481188387305001/?locale=en_US).

WhatsApp relies on Meta's infrastructure, such as servers, to support people around the world with fast and reliable services. In general, access to WhatsApp personal data is restricted, so it's only used by other Meta apps to determine how many people we serve and keep people safe, or when a user chooses to use an optional feature that works across Meta products.

WhatsApp in Accounts Centre is one of these optional features. Other optional features include chatting with Meta AI or messaging businesses that are using Meta's business tools. Optional features are always explained clearly in the app so you can make the choice that's right for you.

What information is collected by WhatsApp when you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy) describes information that WhatsApp collects on its services. When you choose to add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre, WhatsApp also collects information such as:

To enable you to use connected experiences available through Accounts Centre, WhatsApp also receives information from other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/481188387305001/?locale=en_US), such as:

What information will Meta receive about you if you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre, other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/481188387305001/?locale=en_US) receive information such as:

For what purposes WhatsApp uses your info if you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre, WhatsApp uses your info for purposes such as the following:

How Meta uses your info if you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you choose to add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre, Meta will use your information as described in the [Meta Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/), to do things such as provide, personalise and improve its products and services, including to show you ads, measure their performance and provide more personalised features, content and suggestions across [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/532729362019677), as well as promote safety, security and integrity. Meta's own terms and privacy policy will govern your use of Meta services and products.

Of course, WhatsApp relies on Meta's infrastructure, such as servers, to support people around the world with fast and reliable services. However, access to WhatsApp personal data is restricted so it will not be used by other Meta apps – including for ads – unless it's to determine how many people we serve, keep people safe or to provide optional features that work across Meta products.

WhatsApp in Accounts Centre is one of these optional features. Other optional features include chatting with Meta AI or messaging businesses that are using Meta's business tools. Optional features are always explained clearly in the app so you can make the choice that's right for you.

Does adding WhatsApp to Accounts Centre affect whether Meta uses your information when you message a business or share your info with them
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having your accounts in the same Accounts Centre does not affect whether your info is used if you choose to share it with businesses or if you message them on our products.

Learn more about [how Meta uses your information across your accounts in the same Accounts Centre](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/accounts-center/433719745369721/).

Which of your settings will change
----------------------------------

Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre will allow you to manage certain settings in one place for your WhatsApp accounts, and any other accounts that you have in the same Accounts Centre. These include things such as adjusting your profile information across accounts, and whether to always crosspost status across your apps. For a full list of settings controlled through Accounts Centre, read more [here](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/accounts-center/1894490827562393/).

If you don't want to add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You don't have to. Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre is completely optional. If you choose not to add your WhatsApp account to the same Accounts Centre as your Facebook or Instagram accounts, you can still use WhatsApp as you always have.

If you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre and then change your mind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre, you allow us to combine and use your information across accounts in Accounts Centre on different [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/532729362019677). You can remove your WhatsApp account from Accounts Centre at any time.

If you remove your WhatsApp account from Accounts Centre, we'll stop [combining your info](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/accounts-center/433719745369721/) between your WhatsApp account and the other accounts still in your Accounts Centre within seven days. If you remove your WhatsApp account, your previously combined info would remain combined.

You opted out of sharing your WhatsApp account information with Meta in 2016. How does adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre affect you
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you opted out of sharing your WhatsApp account information with Meta to improve Meta ads and product experiences in 2016, then adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Centre means that you are opting into this sharing, and all sharing associated with Accounts Centre as described above.

WhatsApp Avatars Features Privacy Notice
========================================

Effective July 14, 2023

This WhatsApp Avatars Features Privacy Notice applies if you opt in to these avatars features. It explains how we use and protect your information in order to generate recommended avatars and support avatar calling, and supplements the

[WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).  

**Recommended Avatars**

The recommended avatars feature enables WhatsApp, LLC to quickly recommend avatars to you using a photo of yourself that you capture and submit when creating your avatar. If you choose to use the recommended avatars feature, you will need to agree to this privacy notice.  

**Information used to provide the recommended avatars feature**

In order for WhatsApp to recommend avatars inspired by your appearance, we analyze your photo to estimate the location of parts of your face, like your eyes, nose and mouth, and specific points on the contours of those parts of your face ("estimated facial points"). We also analyze your photo to detect the approximate size, shape and color pigment of certain areas of your face ("predicted facial attributes"). Our technology then uses your estimated facial points and predicted facial attributes to create avatars inspired by you, which WhatsApp then recommends to you. If you choose to, you can use the avatar editor tool to customize the recommended avatars before selecting your final avatar. None of this information is used to identify you, and it will be used for the sole purpose of recommending avatars inspired by you.  

Once you select your final avatar, your photo, estimated facial points, predicted facial attributes, and recommended avatars will begin being processed for deletion immediately. The full deletion process may take up to 14 days to complete.  

Subject to WhatsApp's privacy policy, your final avatar will be stored by WhatsApp and on your device so that you can use it for interactive digital experiences on WhatsApp. Once your final avatar has been created, you can delete it at any time by clicking “Delete Avatar” in your WhatsApp avatar settings. Your final avatar will also be automatically deleted if you delete your WhatsApp account.  

**Avatar Calling**

The avatar calling feature enables you to participate in WhatsApp video calls as your personal avatar. Avatar calling is an augmented reality feature that replaces your video with your live avatar.

**Information used to provide the avatar calling feature**

If you choose to use avatar calling, we need to ensure that your avatar appears where you would be in the video and that it displays your facial expressions and movements in real time (camera effects).  

To facilitate avatar calling, WhatsApp will estimate the location of parts of your face (like your eyes, nose or mouth) and specific points on the contours of those parts of your face ("estimated facial points"). We will apply these estimated facial points to a generic model of a face and adjust it to mimic your facial expressions and movements.

This information is not used to identify you. It is used only to provide the avatar calling feature during your video calls. When you stop using the feature or the video call ends, we will stop processing this information. We don’t store this information or share it with third parties.

Subject to WhatsApp's privacy policy, your avatar will be stored by WhatsApp and on your device so that it can be used for avatar calling. You can delete it at any time by clicking “Delete Avatar” in your WhatsApp avatar settings. Your avatar will also be automatically deleted if you delete your WhatsApp account.

WhatsApp Face and Hand Effects Privacy Notice
=============================================

Effective October 15, 2024

This Privacy Notice applies if you opt in to face and hand effects. It explains how we use and protect your information in order to generate these camera effects and supplements the [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Face and hand effects are augmented reality features that react as people in the scene move, speak and express themselves. They include filters, masks and other interactive digital experiences. You can use these effects in your camera, photos and videos.

#### **Information we use to make face and hand effects work**

When you use face and hand effects, we need to show them in the right place in your camera, photos and videos and make some effects react to your gestures, expressions or movements. For example, if you select puppy ears, we need to make sure the ears appear on the top of your head and stay there as you move. To do this, we estimate the location of parts of your face (like your eyes, nose or mouth) and points on your face, eyes or hands. For some effects, we apply these points to a generic model of a face and adjust it to mimic your facial expressions and movements. This information is not used to identify you.

#### **What we do with this information**

We don’t process or store this information on our servers or share it with third parties. The information is processed, but not stored on your device and is deleted following your use of the chosen effect.

#### **Using face and hand effects with other people**

When you use face and hand effects, we may process information from images of other people who appear in your camera feed, photo or video. For example, when you use effects on a video call, someone in the background may have puppy ears shown on their head.

### **WhatsApp Channels Supplemental Privacy Policy**

Effective January 21, 2025

This WhatsApp Channels Supplemental Privacy Policy helps explain our information practices when you use WhatsApp Channels (“Channels”). When we say “WhatsApp”, “our”, “we” or “us”, we are referring to WhatsApp LLC.

This Channels Privacy Policy supplements the WhatsApp [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#privacy-policy), which applies to the use of all our Services, including Channels. Any capitalized terms used but not defined in this Channels Privacy Policy have the meanings defined in the WhatsApp Privacy Policy. If there is any conflict between this Channels Privacy Policy and the WhatsApp Privacy Policy, this Channels Privacy Policy will control solely with respect to your use of Channels and only to the extent of the conflict.

The [Supplemental Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-terms-of-service/) for WhatsApp Channels and [WhatsApp Channels Guidelines](https://faq.whatsapp.com/245599461477281) apply to your use of Channels.

#### **What does this Channels Privacy Policy cover?**

Channels is an optional, one-way broadcasting feature within WhatsApp, separate from our private messaging services, that allows you to create a Channel (making you a Channel “Admin”) where you may share updates for others to view (“Channel Content”). You can also view and interact with Channel Content, and follow particular Channels as a follower (“Follower”). Non-followers (“Viewers”) can also view and interact with Channel Content.

Channels are public, meaning that anyone can discover, follow, and view your Channel. Given the public nature and unlimited audience size of Channels, Channel Content will be visible to any user and by WhatsApp. This also means that Channel Content is among the information WhatsApp collects and uses to promote safety, security and integrity on Channels, as further described in this Channels Privacy Policy, the [Supplemental Terms](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-terms-of-service/), and in the [WhatsApp Channels Guidelines](https://faq.whatsapp.com/245599461477281).

Importantly, your use of WhatsApp Channels does not impact the privacy of your WhatsApp personal messages, which continue to be end-to-end encrypted as described in the [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#privacy-policy).

In the future, we may introduce additional Channels features, such as new ways to search for Channels and Channel Content, additional audience and privacy settings for Channels, and end-to-end encrypted Channels. If you are already using Channels when we update features and settings, we will inform you of such features as appropriate.

#### Information from and about Channel Admins

#### **How We Use Information**

We use the information we collect in the following additional ways:

*   **Provide Channels**. We use the information we have to operate, provide, and improve Channels. For example, we may use this information to enable you to create, follow or interact with Channels, to help us to provide or develop additional Channels features, or to [improve](https://faq.whatsapp.com/962978635456336/) your experience on Channels such as to show or recommend to you Channels that are in your country or local language.
*   **Understand Usage of Channels**. We use the information to measure and analyze the effectiveness, performance, reliability and efficiency of Channels, to understand how people use and interact with Channels, and to determine how we can develop and improve our Services.

#### **How information is shared**

Channels information is shared in the following ways:

*   **Third-Party Service Providers and Meta Companies**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand and support Channels. We also work with [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us promote the safety, security, and integrity on Channels and our Services, including use of detection and measurement tools that leverage a combination of classifiers, content and behavioral signals, human review, and user reports—to proactively and reactively detect potentially violating content or use of Channels. When we share information with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.

*   **Accounts Center.** If you have added your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center, see [here](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/Information-used-across-accounts-wa/) to learn more about how your information will be shared.

#### **Managing And Retaining Your Information**

You can [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/6480469855345352/?cms_platform=web), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/214063281402212/?cms_platform=web) or [port](https://faq.whatsapp.com/6480469855345352/?cms_platform=web) your Channels information using our in-app settings set out in the [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

*   **Retaining your public Channel Content and Channel information**. In the ordinary course of providing Channels, we store Channel Content on our servers for up to 30 days, subject to safety, security and integrity purposes or other legal or compliance obligations that may require longer retention. Channel Content may remain on Viewers’ or Followers’ devices for a longer period, though we may provide options for Channel Content to disappear faster, for example after 7 days or 24 hours should Admins choose. We store other Channels information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Channels Privacy Policy, and the WhatsApp Privacy Policy, including to provide Channels or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our terms and policies, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations.
*   **Deleting your Channel**. If you are an Admin, [deleting your Channel](https://faq.whatsapp.com/598838008878228) removes the channel and Channel Content from the Tab in your app at which point it is no longer accessible to other users through Channels. It may take up to 90 days to delete your Channels information on our servers.

We are one of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). You can learn more further below in this Privacy Policy about the ways in which we share information across this family of companies.

This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.

Please also read WhatsApp’s [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) ("Terms"), which describe the terms under which you use and we provide our Services.

### Key Updates

Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.

### Information We Collect

WhatsApp must receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.

The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.

Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your location with your contacts if you do not permit us to collect your location data from your device. Permissions can be managed through your Settings menu on both Android and iOS devices.

#### Information You Provide

*   **Your Account Information**. You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account.

You can add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and "about" information.

*   **Your Messages**. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them:
    *   **Undelivered Messages**. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.
    *   **Media Forwarding**. When a user forwards media within a message, we store that media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.  
          
        We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.

We collect and use precise location information from your device with your permission when you choose to use [location-related features](https://faq.whatsapp.com/675327250630399), like when you decide to share your location with your contacts or view locations nearby or locations others have shared with you. There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country). We also use your location information for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.
*   **Cookies**. We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize them. For example, we use cookies to provide our Services for web and desktop and other web-based services. We may also use cookies to understand which of our Help Center articles are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customize our Services for you. [Learn more](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/cookies) about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.

  

### Third-Party Information

*   **Information Others Provide About You**. We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (like information from their mobile address book) just as you may provide theirs. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.  
    You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.  
    
*   **User Reports**. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is made, we collect information on both the reporting user and reported user. To find out more about what happens when a user report is made, please see [Advanced Safety and Security Features](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/staying-safe-on-whatsapp).
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**. Businesses you interact with using our Services may provide us with information about their interactions with you. We require each of these businesses to act in accordance with applicable law when providing any information to us.  
    When you message with a business on WhatsApp, keep in mind that the content you share may be visible to several people in that business. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Meta) to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service provider access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties or Meta, you should review that business’ privacy policy or contact the business directly.  
    
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with them to distribute our apps; provide our technical and physical infrastructure, delivery, and other systems; provide engineering support, cybersecurity support, and operational support; supply location, map, and places information; process payments; help us understand how people use our Services; market our Services; help you connect with businesses using our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; ensure safety, security, and integrity; and help with customer service. These companies may provide us with information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us with reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.  
    The "[How We Work With Other Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-other-meta-companies)" section below provides more information about how WhatsApp collects and shares information with the other [Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-other-meta-companies).  
    
*   **Third-Party Services**. We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). If you use our Services with such third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

### How We Use Information

We use information we have (subject to choices you make and applicable law) to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. Here's how:

*   **Our Services**. We use information we have to operate and provide our Services, including providing customer support; completing purchases or transactions; improving, fixing, and customizing our Services; and connecting our Services with [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) that you may use. We also use information we have to understand how people use our Services; evaluate and improve our Services; research, develop, and test new services and features; and conduct troubleshooting activities. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
*   **Safety, Security, And Integrity**. Safety, security, and integrity are an integral part of our Services. We use information we have to verify accounts and activity; combat harmful conduct; protect users against bad experiences and spam; and promote safety, security, and integrity on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms and policies, and to ensure our Services are being used legally. Please see the [Law, Our Rights and Protection](#privacy-policy-law-our-rights-and-protection) section below for more information.
*   **Communications About Our Services And** [**The Meta Companies**](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). We use information we have to communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our terms, policies, and other important updates. We may provide you marketing for our Services and those of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies).

*   **No Third-Party Banner Ads**. We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our Services. We have no intention to introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this Privacy Policy.

*   **Business Interactions**. We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as [Catalogs](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-catalog) for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.

### Information You And We Share

You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.

*   **Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate**. You share your information (including messages) as you use and communicate through our Services.
*   **Information Associated With Your Account**. Your phone number, profile name and photo, "about" information, last seen information, and message receipts are available to anyone who uses our Services, although you can configure your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users, including businesses, with whom you communicate.
*   **Your Contacts And Others**. Users, including businesses, with whom you communicate can store or reshare your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services. You can use your Services settings and the “block” feature in our Services to manage who you communicate with on our Services and certain information you share.
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**. We offer specific services to businesses such as providing them with metrics regarding their use of our Services.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. We work with these companies to support our Services, such as to provide technical infrastructure, delivery and other systems; market our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; protect the safety, security, and integrity of users and others; and assist with customer service. When we share information with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.
*   **Third-Party Services**. When you or others use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another [Meta Company Product](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or [Meta Company Product](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). Please note that when you use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

### How We Work With Other Meta Companies

As part of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information (see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-information-does-whatsapp-share-with-the-facebook-companies)) with, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings, including the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). This includes:

*   helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems;
*   understanding how our Services or theirs are used;
*   promoting safety, security, and integrity across the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), e.g., securing systems and fighting spam, threats, abuse, or infringement activities;
*   improving their services and your experiences using them, such as making suggestions for you (for example, of friends or group connections, or of interesting content), personalizing features and content, helping you complete purchases and transactions, and showing relevant offers and ads across the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products); and
*   providing integrations which enable you to connect your WhatsApp experiences with other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). For example, allowing you to connect your Facebook Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp or enabling you to chat with your friends on other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), such as Portal, by connecting your WhatsApp account.

Learn more about the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) and their privacy practices by reviewing their privacy policies.

### Assignment, Change Of Control, And Transfer

In the event that we are involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring, bankruptcy, or sale of all or some of our assets, we will share your information with the successor entities or new owners in connection with the transaction in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

### Managing And Retaining Your Information

You can access or port your information using our in-app Request Account Info feature (available under Settings > Account). For iPhone users, you can learn how to [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-request-your-account-information), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-edit-your-profile), and [delete](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account) your information through our [iPhone Help Center articles](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/). For Android users, you can learn how to [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-request-your-account-information), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-edit-your-profile), and [delete](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account) your information through our [Android Help Center articles](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/).

We store information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, including to provide our Services or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations.

If you would like to further manage, change, limit, or delete your information, you can do that through the following tools:

*   **Services Settings**. You can change your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users. You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our “block” feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.
*   **Changing Your Mobile Phone Number, Profile Name And Picture, And “About” Information**. If you change your mobile phone number, you must update it using our in-app change number feature and transfer your account to your new mobile phone number. You can also change your profile name, profile picture, and "about" information at any time.
*   **Deleting Your WhatsApp Account**. You can delete your WhatsApp account at any time (including if you want to revoke your consent to our use of your information pursuant to applicable law) using our in-app delete my account feature. When you delete your WhatsApp account, your undelivered messages are deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer need to operate and provide our Services. Deleting your account will, for example, delete your account info and profile photo, delete you from all WhatsApp groups, and delete your WhatsApp message history. Be mindful that if you only delete WhatsApp from your device without using our in-app delete my account feature, your information will be stored with us for a longer period. Please remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect your information related to the groups you created or the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you sent them.

You can learn more [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account/) about our data deletion and retention practices and about how to delete your account.

### Law, Our Rights, And Protection

We access, preserve, and share your information described in the "[Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect)" section of this Privacy Policy above if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: (a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, legal process, or government requests; (b) enforce our Terms and any other applicable terms and policies, including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, or address fraud and other illegal activity or security, and technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, WhatsApp, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

### Our Global Operations

WhatsApp shares information globally, both internally within the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) and externally with our partners and service providers, and with those with whom you communicate around the world, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States; countries or territories where the [Meta Companies’](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) affiliates and partners, or our service providers are located; or any other country or territory globally where our Services are provided outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. WhatsApp uses Meta’s global infrastructure and data centers, including in the United States. These transfers are necessary to provide the global Services set forth in our Terms. Please keep in mind that the countries or territories to which your information is transferred may have different privacy laws and protections than what you have in your home country or territory.

### Updates To Our Policy

We may amend or update our Privacy Policy. We will provide you notice of amendments to this Privacy Policy, as appropriate, and update the “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy from time to time.

### Key Updates

WhatsApp has made several updates to its Privacy Policy. The key changes include:

*   We’ve added information about how WhatsApp provides an option for users to message with Meta AI.  
    
*   We’ve added information about our calling features including new calling and media effects which you can access through your camera.  
    
*   We’ve updated information on how contacts are securely saved to WhatsApp to allow you to restore on a new device or manage across companion devices.  
    

**As always, your personal messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. No one else, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.**

### WhatsApp Legal Info

_If you live in the_ [European Region](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1013614932324960/)_, WhatsApp Ireland Limited ("__**WhatsApp**__," "__**our**__," "__**we**__," or "__**us**__") provides our_ [_Services_](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea) _to you under the_ [_Terms of Service_](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea) _and this Privacy Policy._

Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we've aspired to build our [Services](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea) with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.

We are one of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/3328550797183840/). Our Privacy Policy ("**Privacy Policy**") explains our data practices, including the information we process to provide our [Services](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea).

For example, our Privacy Policy talks about what information we collect and how this affects you. It also explains the steps we take to protect your privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren't stored by us and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.

This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise. Some products or features that we offer have supplemental privacy policies which supplement this WhatsApp Privacy Policy. These can be found [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/supplemental-privacy-policies-eea/).

If you are a user of another messaging service that is interoperable with WhatsApp under Article 7 of the Digital Markets Act, then this [notice](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/dma-notice-non-users) applies to you for the limited processing activities that enable interoperable messaging.

Please also read WhatsApp's [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea) ("**Terms**"), which describe the terms under which you use and we provide our Services.

### Information We Collect

The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain of [Your Account Information](#privacy-policy-info-you-provide-your-account-information) in accordance with our Terms to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.

  

Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such a collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your [Precise Location Information](#privacy-policy-precise-location-information) with your contacts if you do not enable location sharing on your device. Permissions can be managed through your device-based settings on both [Android](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1142102709454694/) and [iOS](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1533984453785262/?cms_platform=iphone) devices.

As always, your personal messages and calls remain end-to-end encrypted. No one else, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.

### **Information You Provide**

*   **Your Account Information**. You must provide your mobile phone number and a profile name of your choice to create a WhatsApp account. If you don’t provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other optional information to your account, such as a profile picture, and "about" information.
*   **User Content.**
    *   Your Messages, Media within Messages, and Calls: We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your calls, messages, media within messages including content like images, audio, video, documents and files are encrypted to protect against third parties (including WhatsApp) from seeing that content. Learn more about [end-to-end encryption](https://faq.whatsapp.com/791574747982248/) and [how businesses communicate with you on WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/567302067179554/).  
          
        Typically your messages are stored on your device(s) and not on our servers. We temporarily store your messages in encrypted form while they are being delivered. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers.  
          
        If a message cannot be delivered, we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days while we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. We cannot see the contents of undelivered messages stored on our servers as they are encrypted.  
          
        When a user sends media within a message, we store that media for up to 30 days in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery, such as if recipients choose to forward the media. We cannot see the media as it is encrypted.
    *   Status Information. You can choose to share your Status, which is also end-to-end encrypted.
    *   Precise Location Information. We enable you to share your Precise Location Information from your device when you choose to use location-related features, like when you decide to share your current location with, or send live location to your contacts, or view locations nearby. Precise Location Information that you share with your contacts in your chats is encrypted so WhatsApp cannot see it. You can control your Precise Location Information sharing in your in-app settings (see more information for [iPhone](https://faq.whatsapp.com/480865177351335/?cms_platform=iphone&helpref=platform_switcher) and [Android](https://faq.whatsapp.com/2720859504657846/)) and your device-based settings.
    *   You may also provide content that is not encrypted which means that we can see it. This includes your profile picture, your "about" information and names and descriptions of your communities and groups. When you choose to use certain avatars features, such as using a photo to enable us to suggest an avatar that more closely resembles you, we process the photo and parts of your face or body features in the photo frame. The information we use for this process is not used to identify you.
*   **Your Connections**.  
    You can use contact upload and provide us with contact information from your device address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information in a way that is designed to ensure that those contacts cannot be identified by us. Learn more [about contact upload](https://faq.whatsapp.com/423109552047857/) and about the information we provide to people who do not use WhatsApp [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/information-for-people-who-dont-use-whatsapp). We also collect information on users who contact you that aren't in your device address book and any users you've blocked or who have blocked you.
*   **Your Community and Group Information**.  
    You can create, join, or get added to communities, groups and broadcast lists, and such communities, groups and lists get associated with your account. You can give your groups and communities a name. You can also provide a community or group profile picture or description. We also collect information about when communities and groups are created or updated.
*   **Customer Support Information And Other Communications**.  
    When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us (for example, through optional surveys), you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful in order for us to understand and resolve your query, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues. We also collect information on how you use our customer support features (e.g., the searches you make on our Help Center), any feedback you give us on the customer support experience and your responses to surveys or questions on a range of topics (including, for example, what you like or don't like about the Service or Meta Companies).
*   **Account Access Information**.  
    When you sign up or log-in to our Service, we verify your WhatsApp account, for example, by sending you a code via SMS or calling you. You can also add a PIN to enable two-step verification and an email address that can be used to reset that PIN. Depending on the circumstances, we ask you for information to prove that you are the true owner of your WhatsApp account.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

*   **Usage Information**.  
    We collect information about your usage of our Services. This includes collecting information about your activity (including how you use our Services), how you interact with others using our Services (including when you search for and interact with a business), the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This also includes information about the features you use like our messaging (and integrated applications), calling, Status, avatars, communities, groups or business features; whether you are online; timestamps related to your use such as when you last used our Services (your "last seen") and the times you send and receive calls and messages; and when you last updated your "about" information.
*   **Log and Troubleshooting Information**.  
    We collect information about how our Services are performing when you use them, like service related diagnostic and performance information. This information includes log files, timestamps, diagnostic or crash data, website performance logs and error messages or reports.
*   **Device And Connection Information**.  
    We collect device and connection-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information including whether you are using wifi or cellular data, mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information and identifiers (including identifiers unique to [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/525261298319691/) associated with the same device or account).
*   **General Location Information**.  
    Even if you do not choose to use our precise location-related features (see [Information Shared by You and by WhatsApp with Third Parties](#privacy-policy-information-you-and-we-share)), we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes, to estimate your general location (e.g., country / region).
*   **Cookies**.  
    We collect information using cookies to operate and provide our web-based Services and website. [Learn more](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/cookies) about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.
*   **User Choices**.  
    We collect information about your in-app settings, privacy settings and records about when you accepted terms. Only you are in control of your [privacy settings](https://faq.whatsapp.com/195231088335525/) which can be used to change, for example, who can see your "last seen and online", profile photo, "about" information, Status updates, read receipts or add you to groups. We also collect information about whether you have enabled push notifications and whether you wish to send disappearing messages.
*   **Authentication Information**.  
    To verify and grant appropriate authorisations as you use the Services (such as when you choose to use encrypted backups and create your unique password), we create and store authentication codes which are a security measure to ensure only you are accessing your account. Authentication Information also includes your public encryption keys that our end-to-end encryption protocol uses. Messages are encrypted before they reach our servers which means that we cannot see them.

### **Information Third Parties Provide About You**

*   **Information Others Provide About You**.  
    We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your contact information if they use [contact upload](https://faq.whatsapp.com/423109552047857/) just as you may provide theirs. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.
*   **User Reports**.  
    Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is submitted to us through the reporting tools, we receive information from the reporter on both the reporting user and those reported. To find out more about the information we receive when a User Report is submitted to us and what happens when a User Report is submitted, please see [About blocking and reporting contacts](https://faq.whatsapp.com/408155796838822/).
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**.  
    When businesses you interact with while using our Services provide us with information about their interactions with you, we require each of these businesses to act in accordance with applicable law.  
      
    When you [message with a business on WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/567302067179554/), keep in mind that the content you share may be visible to several people in that business. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Meta) to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service providers access to its communications to send, store, read, manage or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties or Meta, you should review that business’s privacy policy or contact the business directly.
*   **Third-Party Services**.  
    WhatsApp receives information about bad actors and abuse from [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/3328550797183840/) and app verification information from anti-abuse services to promote safety, security and integrity. For example, when Meta becomes aware of a scam encouraging individuals to contact a phone number via WhatsApp, they might share that phone number with WhatsApp so we can investigate the WhatsApp account.  
      
    We also allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/525261298319691/). If you use our Services with such third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/525261298319691/), we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services.  
      
    When you choose to communicate with users of third party interoperable messaging services under Article 7 of the Digital Markets Act, we receive limited information to enable you to successfully send and receive messages, namely whether your messages are successfully delivered, information about the type of message (text or media) and when it was sent.  
      
      
    Please note that when you use third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/525261298319691/), the terms and privacy policies of the company that offers those services will govern your use of those services and products.

### Information Shared by You and by WhatsApp with Third Parties

You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customise and support our Services.

  

*   **Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate**. You share [User Content](#privacy-policy-info-you-provide-user-content) when you communicate through our Services or if you choose to communicate with users of third party interoperable messaging services. You are in control of what you are sending when you send your information to the individual or business WhatsApp users you choose to communicate with. Please be mindful that, once you have sent User Content to a WhatsApp user, they can store or reshare it with others on and off our Services.
*   **Information Associated With Your Account**. As part of your WhatsApp messaging experience and based on your privacy settings, those users who have your phone number can see Your Account Information (phone number, profile photo, "about" information), and can add you to groups and communities where this information is then potentially visible to others in the group or community. When you send a message to another user or to a group, your chosen profile name will become visible to the recipients of the message, including users who do not have you in their contact list. Users who have your phone number can also see your "last seen and online" information and your message receipts, depending on your privacy settings. You can configure your privacy settings to manage group membership, and certain information (for example, your "last seen") available to other users. Please see our Help Center for more information on [how to change your privacy settings](https://faq.whatsapp.com/195231088335525/).
*   **Third-Party Services**. When you, or other users you interact with, use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/525261298319691/) that are linked through our Services, or if you choose to communicate with users on third party interoperable messaging services, the providers of those services or products may receive the information about you that you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive the information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages, and if you search the web from WhatsApp for a group profile picture, the search engine provider will receive the search term you use. If you interact with a third-party service or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/525261298319691/) through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform like YouTube or Facebook, information like your IP address and technical information showing that the request comes from a WhatsApp app, may be provided to the provider of such service or products. If you choose to communicate with users of third party interoperable messaging services, your phone number and some Usage Information, Device And Connection Information and Authentication Information will be shared with the applicable third party interoperable messaging service. Please note that when you use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/525261298319691/), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers. We work with third-party service providers to help us provide our Services.**  
      
    When we share information with third-party service providers in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.  
      
    We work with the following different types of third-party service providers:
    *   telecommunications technology providers to send you SMS messages, or call you, to verify your account. To be able to provide these services, these providers receive Your Account Information (phone number) and Account Access Information (verification codes to enable you to verify a new phone number or device connected to your account). The providers we currently use are located in Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK and the United States.
    *   a content safety technology service provider that helps us to maintain the safety and integrity of the Services by detecting and helping us to prioritise harmful material for our reviewers to assess. To provide these services, this provider receives certain images from User Reports (e.g. images), Your Account Information (e.g. profile picture) and Your Community and Group Information (e.g. community or group profile picture). The provider we currently use is located in the United States.
    *   a location data provider to enable you to share your location or a nearby place with other WhatsApp users. To be able to provide these services, this provider receives Precise Location Information (your current location and other locations you choose on the map). The provider we currently use is located in the United States.

Please also see the [How We Work With Other Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-how-we-work-with-other-meta-companies) and [Working with Authorities, Advisors and Industry Partners](#privacy-policy-working-with-authorities) sections for further information we share.

| **For protecting your vital interests or those of another person**.<br><br>We apply automated processing techniques and conduct manual (human) review. We share information with law enforcement and others, in circumstances where someone’s vital interests require protection, such as in the case of emergencies. These vital interests include protection of your or someone else’s life, physical or mental health, wellbeing or integrity or that of others.<br><br>In protecting such vital interests we aim to combat harmful conduct and promote safety, integrity and security. For example, we investigate reports of harmful conduct and take appropriate action, such as taking action on user accounts (e.g. banning them) or sharing information with relevant authorities, where there is a risk of imminent harmful conduct such as an attack or where a person’s safety is at risk. We also compare profile pictures, community and group pictures and reported images against a database of known hashed child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and use a combination of automated processing techniques and human review to detect previously unknown CSAM in these images. If we detect apparent CSAM, we report it to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (learn more about how we work to help fight child exploitation [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/154956905959033/)). | *   [Your Account Information](#privacy-policy-info-you-provide-your-account-information)<br>*   [User Content](#privacy-policy-info-you-provide-user-content) (if provided by a user)  <br>    <br>*   [Your Connections](#privacy-policy-info-you-provide-your-connections)<br>*   [Your Community and Group Information](#privacy-policy-info-you-provide-your-group-info)<br>*   [Customer Support Information and Other Communications](#privacy-policy-customer-support-info-comms)<br>*   [Usage Information](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-info-usage-information)<br>*   [Log and Troubleshooting Information](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-info-log-troubleshoot)<br>*   [Device and Connection Information](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-info-device-connection)<br>*   [General Location Information](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-general-location-info)<br>*   [Cookies](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-cookies)<br>*   [User Choices](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-user-choices)<br>*   [Information Others Provide About You](#privacy-policy-third-party-info-others-provide)<br>*   [User Reports](#privacy-policy-third-party-user-reports)<br>*   [Businesses on WhatsApp](#privacy-policy-third-party-businesses-on-whatsapp)<br>*   [Third-Party Services](#privacy-policy-third-party-third-party-services) |

You have the right to object to, and seek restriction of, this processing. To exercise your rights, visit the [How To Exercise Your Rights](#privacy-policy-how-to-exercise-your-rights) section of this Privacy Policy.

We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our Services. We have no intention to introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this Privacy Policy.

### How To Exercise Your Rights

Under applicable data protection law, you have the right to access, rectify, port, and erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information.

  

This includes the right to object to our processing of your information for direct marketing and the right to object to our processing of your information where we are pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third-party. We will consider several factors when assessing an objection including: your reasonable expectations; the benefits and risks to you, us, other users, third parties; and other available means to achieve the same purpose that may be less invasive and do not require disproportionate effort. Your objection will be upheld, and we will cease processing your information, unless the processing is based on compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons.

You have the right to object to and restrict our processing of your information. To submit an objection use [this form](https://www.whatsapp.com/contact/forms/382532939919295/) and select “How can I make an objection to the processing of my information”. Learn more about submitting an objection and the way we use your information by going [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/505412866985020/). If we use your information for direct marketing, you can always object and opt out of future direct marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in such communications, or by using our in-app "block" feature.

You can access or port your information using our in-app Request Account Info feature (available under Settings > Account). You can access tools to rectify, update, and delete your information directly in-app as described in the [Retention of Your Information](#privacy-policy-retention-of-your-information) section.

When we process information you provide to us based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. To withdraw your consent, visit your device-based settings or in-app settings.

You have the right to lodge a complaint with WhatsApp's lead supervisory authority under the GDPR, the Irish Data Protection Commission, or any other competent data protection supervisory authority.

### Retention of Your Information

We store information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, including to provide our Services, or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, or protecting or defending our rights, property and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on the following factors:

*   **The nature of the information and why it is collected and processed**. The length of time we will keep your information will generally be determined by how long we need that information to provide you with our Services, including any optional features you use and to provide customer support.  
      
    For example:
    *   As described [above](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect), we require certain of [Your Account Information](#privacy-policy-info-you-provide-your-account-information) to deliver our Services. We need to keep it for the lifetime of your account so that we can maintain your account.
    *   We keep your [User Choices](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-user-choices) for the lifetime of your account.
    *   We keep [Authentication Information](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-authentication-info) for the lifetime of your account.
    *   We only need to keep other information as long as necessary to provide optional features to you, such as [Your Connections](#privacy-policy-info-you-provide-your-connections) as long as you use contact upload.
    *   We keep information collected using [Cookies](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-cookies) for 90 days.
    *   We generally keep [customer support communications](#privacy-policy-customer-support-info-comms) for 30 days after they have been dealt with or 90 days after we receive them, whichever is sooner.
    *   We generally keep [User Reports](#privacy-policy-third-party-user-reports) for 90 days.
*   In certain cases, we need to keep your information for longer for legal reasons as described under the Legal Reasons section below.
*   **Legal Reasons**. In certain cases, we also keep your information for legal reasons, including after your account has been deleted.  
      
    We keep your information:
    *   **To respond to a legal request or to comply with applicable law when we have a legal obligation to retain information**. For example, if we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account, we preserve your information after you delete your account.
    *   **To deal with and resolve requests and complaints**. For example, we generally retain correspondence relating to data subject requests under GDPR for a year, in case those requests are not resolved and this correspondence is required in order to handle any resulting complaints. In such cases, the correspondence is then retained while those complaints are being resolved.
    *   **For litigation or regulatory matters**. For example, we preserve your information where it is reasonably necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint, such as where we are subject to a regulatory investigation or we need to defend ourselves in legal proceedings about a claim related to your information or respond to a regulator in relation to a complaint made by you or someone else.
    *   **Issues relating to the safety, security and integrity of our Services and to protect rights, property and users**. For example, we keep information where it is necessary to investigate misuse of our [Services](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea), such as spam and other bad experiences. If we disable an account for violating our [Terms](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=1#terms-of-service), we also preserve information about that user for safety, security and integrity purposes.

The actual information that we keep and how long we keep it for depends on the nature of the reason in question.

*   **Operational Retention Needs**. We need to store information in certain cases for operational needs. For example, if a message cannot be delivered immediately, we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. We also store information where necessary for troubleshooting and debugging issues with the Services. We keep the information that we store for this purpose for up to 90 days, provided longer storage is not necessary for investigating and resolving a specific issue, or for legal reasons.
*   **Messaging**. We retain the information that we process to convey your messages or calls (which includes information like your phone number, the time and date you make a call or send a message, or the duration of your calls) in accordance with the specific rules and requirements under the EU Directive 2002/58/EC, where applicable, as long as it is needed for transmitting the communication, operating our Services, ensuring the safety and security of our Services, or to comply with legal obligations under applicable law. When we do not need the information for any of these purposes anymore, we delete or anonymise it.

### Deleting Your Information

**What Happens To Your Information When Your Account Is Deleted?** When you delete your WhatsApp account or when it is deleted as a result of inactivity (see [About inactive account deletion](https://faq.whatsapp.com/2551264625111105/) for information on inactive accounts), we delete the information we have about you, apart from the information listed below which we retain in limited circumstances.

  

**Deleted Information**. Your Account Information and any undelivered messages to you are deleted from our servers. You will be removed from all WhatsApp communities and groups. Note that for technical reasons it takes up to 90 days from the beginning of the deletion process to delete or de-identify your WhatsApp information. Copies of your information may also remain after the 90 days for a limited time in the backup storage that we use to recover lost information in the event of a disaster, software error, or other information loss event.

**Information We Retain After Your Account is Deleted.**

*   If we are analysing or investigating a security incident, in order to maintain the security of our Services, we need to retain [Log and Troubleshooting Information](#privacy-policy-auto-collect-info-log-troubleshoot) associated with the incident that we are reviewing past the normal 90 day deletion period.
*   Copies of certain log records remain in our database but are disassociated from personal identifiers which are used for example to measure performance, reliability and efficiency and to operate and improve our Services.
    *   Your account initially was linked to these records by a randomly generated identifier. To disassociate this information when your account is deleted, we delete the link between this identifier and your account as part of the account deletion process.
*   Copies of your information may also be retained for legal reasons after you delete your account in the circumstances described. The information that may be retained and length of time we need to retain it will depend on the specific legal reason we need to retain it for.

For more information on how long we store information, see [Retention of Your Information](#privacy-policy-retention-of-your-information).

### Managing Your Information

If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your information, you can do that through the following tools:

*   **Settings**. You can change your settings to manage certain information available to other users. You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our "block" feature to manage who you communicate with on our Services.
*   **Changing Your Mobile Phone Number, Profile Name And Picture, And "About" Information**. If you change your mobile phone number you must update it using our in-app change number feature and transfer your account to your new mobile phone number. You can also change your profile name, profile picture, and "about" information at any time.
*   **Deleting Your WhatsApp Account**. You can delete your WhatsApp account at any time using our in-app delete my account feature in your in-app settings. Once you initiate the deletion process for your account, that account can no longer be used (i.e. you cannot log in or re-register or access any content (including message history) as it will be deleted). See [Deleting Your Information](#privacy-policy-deleting-your-information) section for more detail on what happens to your information when you delete your account.

Be mindful that if you only delete WhatsApp from your device without selecting the in-app delete my account option in your in-app settings, the [Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect) will be stored on our servers for a longer period. WhatsApp accounts are generally deleted after 120 days of inactivity. Users are not alerted when this occurs. See our Help Center article [About inactive account deletion](https://faq.whatsapp.com/2551264625111105/) for more information.

Please remember that when your account is deleted, it does not affect your information related to the communities or groups you created (such as community or group names), or the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you sent them.

### Working With Authorities, Advisors And Industry Partners

We access and share your information described in the [Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect) section, including sharing with regulators, law enforcement, other government agencies, industry partners/peers such as other online platforms and technology companies, our advisors such as external lawyers who act for us, and others in accordance with the [How and Why We Process Your Information and Our Legal Basis for Processing](#privacy-policy-legal-basis-for-processing-data) section if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to:

*   respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, court orders, legal process, or government requests. For example, sharing with regulators, law enforcement, or other government agencies in response to legal requests or sharing with civil litigants pursuant to court orders;
*   detect, investigate, prevent, or address fraud and other illegal activity or security and technical issues. For example, we access and share information with law enforcement, other government agencies, or industry partners such as other online platforms and technology companies to identify and prevent bad actors using our Services for illegal purposes; or
*   protect the rights, property and safety of our users, WhatsApp, the Meta Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, sharing with law enforcement, in emergency situations where we learn that a person’s life is at risk.

For more information on how we preserve your information for these purposes, please see the [Retention of Your Information](#privacy-policy-retention-of-your-information) section.

The processing we carry out will depend on the circumstances. Further information on the different categories of information affected and the legal bases we rely on is set out in the [How and Why We Process Your Information and Our Legal Basis for Processing](#privacy-policy-legal-basis-for-processing-data) section under the Processing necessary to perform our contract with you, Compliance with a Legal Obligation, Protection of Your Vital Interests or Those of Another Person and Legitimate Interests headings.

### Transferring information outside the EEA as part of Our Global Operations

**Why is information transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area and where?**  
  
WhatsApp shares information described in the [Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect) section of this Privacy Policy globally, both internally within the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/3328550797183840/), and externally with third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our [Terms](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea). This includes places where the [data centers](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1203123176878760/) we rely on are located, and where our other internal [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/3328550797183840/) and external [Third-Party Service Providers](#privacy-policy-third-party-third-party-services) are located (which includes the United States). These transfers are necessary and essential to enable us to provide the Services set forth in our [Terms](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea) and globally to operate and provide our Services which allow you to communicate with users and businesses on WhatsApp around the world.

  

**How do we safeguard your information?**

When information controlled by WhatsApp is transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States or other third countries outside of the European Economic Area, we rely on the following transfer mechanisms:

*   **Adequacy Decisions**: We rely on decisions from the European Commission where they recognise that certain countries and territories outside of the European Economic Area ensure an adequate level of protection for personal information. These decisions are referred to as “adequacy decisions”. We transfer Your Account Information, Device and Connection Information, Usage Information and User Choices (see [Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect)) from the European Economic Area to Israel in reliance on the European Commission’s adequacy decision for [Israel](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0061).
*   **EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework**: WhatsApp LLC and Meta Platforms, Inc. have certified their participation in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. We rely on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the European Commission's related [adequacy decision](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023D1795&qid=1701807289241), for transfers of [Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect) to WhatsApp LLC and Meta Platforms, Inc. in the U.S. for the services specified in the certifications of WhatsApp LLC and Meta Platforms, Inc. For more information, see the [WhatsApp LLC Data Privacy Framework Disclosure](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-shield) and the [Meta Platforms, Inc. Data Privacy Framework Disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policies/data_privacy_framework/).
*   **Standard Contractual Clauses**: We utilise standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for transfers to third party interoperable messaging services and to the United States, the UK and Singapore. For example, WhatsApp uses Meta’s global infrastructure and data centers, which are located around the world including in the United States, to store the information described in the [Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect) section of this Privacy Policy. For a copy of the standard contractual clauses, please see our [SCC Help Center article](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/about-standard-contractual-clauses).  
      
    While transfers to countries that don’t have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of the standard contractual clauses, in certain circumstances, transfers can also take place on the basis of exemptions provided for under data protection law. For example, sharing with law enforcement, in emergency situations where we learn that a person’s life is at risk.  
      
    If you have any questions about the standard contractual clauses you can [contact us](https://www.whatsapp.com/contact/forms/273295517903076/).
