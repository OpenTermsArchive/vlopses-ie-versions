Mediators List
==============

We have appointed a mediation services provider, the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution ("CEDR") to mediate any claim, cause of action, or Dispute referred to voluntary mediation pursuant to section 16 of the Business Terms.

The parties agree to enter into mediation to settle any claim, cause of action, or Dispute referred by a party for voluntary mediation in good faith and will do so in accordance with the CEDR’s mediation procedures. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of the referral of a claim, cause of action, or Dispute by a party to CEDR, the mediator will be nominated by CEDR.

If you have a question about the mediation process, please [contact us](https://www.whatsapp.com/contact/forms/3017838071697276/).
