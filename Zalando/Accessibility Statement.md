Our Commitment to Accessibility
-------------------------------

At Zalando, accessibility is a core part of our mission. We believe that everyone should have equitable access to fashion and a seamless online shopping experience. To achieve this, we have integrated accessibility into our internal policies and development processes, ensuring that it remains a priority.

Our Accessibility Approach & Process
------------------------------------

Our approach to accessibility is holistic and integrated into every stage of our operations, from product development to quality assurance. We follow a 'shift-left' approach, meaning that accessibility is a foundational requirement from the very beginning of the design and development process, not an afterthought.

Our teams are continuously trained on accessibility best practices and are equipped to ensure that inclusive design is a priority. We have also set up a monitoring strategy, including both self-assessments and external audits, to regularly test our services and validate our progress.

Compliance Status
-----------------

Zalando is dedicated to meeting and exceeding accessibility standards. We are actively working toward compliance with the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA** and the **EN 301 549** European standard, in accordance with the **European Accessibility Act (EAA)** and respective national implementation.

Currently, the Zalando website is **partially compliant** with the aforementioned standards. This means that while most of our content and main features are accessible, some parts do not yet fully comply with the standard.

What is Already Accessible
--------------------------

We have focused on making the most important parts of the shopping journey accessible. Our main user journeys, including **browsing products**, **searching for items**, **adding to cart,** and **checking out**, are accessible to users who rely on screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Additionally, we have implemented **descriptive alt text** for all non-decorative images across our website, ensuring that users with screen readers can understand the visual content.

We have also made most of our interactive components, such as **product carousels**, **pop-up modals**, and **drop-down menus**, accessible to ensure they can be used with assistive technologies and keyboard navigation.

Areas for Improvement
---------------------

We are actively working to address remaining accessibility barriers to provide a fully accessible shopping experience. Some of the areas we are currently improving include:

*   **Error Handling and User Feedback**: We're enhancing form usability by ensuring all fields have proper labels and providing clear, text-based error messages. These messages are programmatically linked to their corresponding fields, making it easy for users with assistive technologies to identify and correct errors.
    
*   **Semantic Structure and Navigation**: We are committed to improving our website's overall structure. We're implementing a logical and consistent heading structure (H1, H2, etc.) across all pages to aid screen reader navigation and improve content comprehension for all users. We are also adding "skip to content" links that become visible upon keyboard focus, allowing users to bypass repetitive navigation elements.
    
*   **Sufficient Contrast**: Beyond just text, we are improving the color contrast of non-text elements such as icons, buttons, and other graphical components. This ensures users with low vision or color vision deficiencies can easily perceive and interact with key parts of the interface.
    
*   **Keyboard and Focus Management**: We are enhancing keyboard navigation for all interactive components to ensure a clear and visible focus indicator.
    
*   **User Preferences**: We are developing support for dynamic text, landscape and a dark mode feature to give users more control over their visual settings.
    
*   **Video Content**: We're actively working to improve the accessibility of our video content. This includes adding captions and audio descriptions for all videos and providing playback controls (play/pause) for all animated content and videos, giving users control over their experience.
    

Technical Specifications
------------------------

Zalando's web accessibility relies on the following technologies, which are necessary for full compliance with our target accessibility standards:

*   **HTML**
    
*   **WAI-ARIA**
    
*   **CSS**
    
*   **JavaScript**
    

We recommend using modern browsers like **Google Chrome**, **Safari**, or **Edge** for the best experience with assistive technologies such as NVDA, VoiceOver, and Talkback.
