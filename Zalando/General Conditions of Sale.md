**Standard Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) for orders placed online at www.zalando.ie**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We would like to familiarise you below with our standard terms and conditions, which govern how we process and settle your purchases.

### **The offers on our website www.zalando.ie are directed exclusively at consumers who conclude the purchase for a purpose that cannot be attributed to their commercial or professional activity.**

The www.zalando.ie website offers "Zalando merchandise" and “Zalando Pre-owned merchandise” (also called “pre-owned”) for sale.  
Zalando Pre-owned merchandise is merchandise that we offer on www.zalando.ie and identify as “pre-owned”.

All Zalando partners are Business Traders.

**1\. Formation of contract and delivery of merchandise**
---------------------------------------------------------

1.1 By placing an order you confirm to purchase for private purposes exclusively.  
1.2 For orders placed online at www.zalando.ie, we enter into English language contracts only. When you order Zalando merchandise and Zalando Pre-owned merchandise, your contract is with Zalando SE, Valeska-Gert-Str. 5, 10243 Berlin.  
1.3 When you order Zalando pre-owned merchandise, depending on the Product you select, you either have a contract solely with the respective Zalando Partner or with both, Zalando SE and the respective Zalando Partner together (joint seller). Information on the respective contractual relationship is displayed on each product details page.  
1.4 By clicking on "Buy now", you are placing a binding order for the items in your shopping cart. Once you have submitted your order, we will immediately send you an e-mail confirmation of your order. A binding contract is formed when you receive the order confirmation from us. Please note that items ordered by advanced payment (reserved) will be dispatched as soon as we receive payment of the full purchase price and any shipping costs. We therefore ask you to transfer the purchase price immediately after receiving the order confirmation, but at least within 7 days.  
1.5 You consent to the assignment of the seller's claims for payment of the purchase price to third parties, in particular to Zalando Payments GmbH.  
1.6 Please note that, by way of exception, we are under no obligation to deliver your order if our suppliers fail to deliver stock correctly or on time, despite us having followed proper ordering practice at our end (matching purchase transaction). For this exception to apply, we must not be legally responsible for the merchandise being unavailable, and we must have notified you of the situation without undue delay. In addition, we must not have assumed a procurement risk in relation to the ordered merchandise. If merchandise is unavailable, we will refund any payments made by you without undue delay.  
1.7 We do not assume the risk of having to procure ordered merchandise elsewhere (procurement risk). This applies also to orders for generic goods (where only the type and features of the goods are described). We are obliged only to make deliveries from our available stock and from the stock we have ordered from our suppliers. Where we make deliveries of goods from our available stock, the goods provided will be consistent with the order made by you. We deliver within Ireland. Where time periods are expressed in working days, we understand working days to mean all of the days between Monday and Friday inclusive, but not public holidays.  
1.8 We inform you about the delivery time on each product detail page as well as before you place an order.  
1.9 We reserve the right not to accept an order or to cancel the order if the order is being placed by the use of software, robot, crawler, spider or any automated system or scripted behavior and any use of third party services used to place an order on your behalf.  
1.10 We hereby reserve the right to exclude customers with conspicuously high (and unusual) product return behaviour from further purchases for a period of up to 12 months. This shall apply, in particular, to repeated, disproportionately high numbers of returns (or instances of return behaviour considered to be ‘abusive’) that do not correspond to normal buyer behaviour.

**2\. Prices, shipping costs and express delivery**
---------------------------------------------------

2.1 The prices set out in the offer as at the date on which the order is placed shall apply. The stated prices are final prices (totals), in other words they include Irish value added tax at the applicable statutory rate. The merchandise remains our property or the property of the relevant Zalando partner, as the case may be, until full payment of the purchase price.  
2.2 We assume the costs of shipping for all orders with a minimum order basket value of €30.00.  
2.3 Shipping costs amount to €3.90 including VAT for all orders with a value of less than €30.00, as indicated on the product detail page and in the shopping cart when placing the order. The fee relates to costs resulting from the size of the order, inter alia shipping handling and other services. The costs accrue and are levied by Zalando. In case that the customer returns the goods within the procedure and in accordance with this contract and the applicable law, the shipping costs will be refunded.  
2.4 Express delivery is available for certain orders. When placing your order, you will see whether this option is available for your particular order as well as the costs of this option. Merchandise will be delivered within 2 working days at the latest. If the merchandise does not arrive within that delivery period, you will of course receive a refund of the delivery costs.  
2.5 Depending on where your item is being shipped from, long-distance delivery fees of €3.90 including VAT may apply. We will inform you accordingly before your order is placed if long-distance delivery fees apply for the item selected. Long-distance delivery costs accrue and are levied by Zalando. If you decide to return any item for which long-distance delivery fees have been charged, we will refund the long-distance delivery fees if the full order is returned. Your statutory rights remain unaffected.

**3\. Payment**

3.1 We generally accept the following payment methods: credit card, prepayment and payment through Paypal. We reserve the right not to accept certain payment methods for a given order and to refer to other payment methods.

3.2 In the case of credit card purchases, your card will be charged when we ship your order.  
3.3 You consent to receiving invoices and credits solely in electronic form.

If the voucher does not cover the value of the merchandise, the difference can be paid using any of the accepted payment methods.

4.4 Promotional vouchers can only be redeemed before the ordering process is complete. It is not possible to apply vouchers retrospectively. Promotional vouchers may not be transferred to third parties. Unless we have agreed otherwise, it is not possible to combine multiple promotional vouchers.  
4.5 If you used a promotional voucher when making your purchase and, as a result of revocation by you, the total value of your order is less than or equal to the value of the promotional voucher, we reserve the right to charge you the original price for the merchandise you retain.

Please help us to avoid unnecessary costs by always using the return shipping label when returning merchandise.

### **Information regarding the right of revocation:**

You have the right to revoke this contract within 14 days without giving any reasons. The period of revocation is 14 days from the day on which you, or a third party designated by you (but who is not the carrier), took possession of the last item of merchandise.

10.2 Please note that when ordering Zalando-Pre-owned items, these are second-hand items. The liability period for defects of Zalando-Pre-owned merchandise is one year.

10.4 For further information in respect of the Zalando Trade In Option for unworn and worn pre-owned clothing, please [**see the Conditions for Trade In Option.**](https://www.zalando.ie/faq/Conditions-for-the-Trade-In-Option.html)

10.8 In the recommender systems we show you articles that we think you might like in order to make your search easier. For this purpose, we use various parameters to make recommendations that are as relevant for you as possible. These most relevant parameters are the country, item information, the selection of filters and sorting, e.g. favoured sizes, and the popularity of items as well as preferences, purchases and browsing activities. The main parameters that significantly influence the display of products on the catalogue page are 1. popularity, 2. the time of introduction of the item, 3. current sales campaigns and 4. the price. The respective parameters for an individual recommender system can be accessed via the "info-i" symbol on the recommender system, for example on the catalogue page. The following link will provide you with further information on the profile information we use and the possibility of influencing the use their use for the recommender systems on the entire platform:

11\. How Our Ranking Works
--------------------------

  
11.1 Our recommender systems are designed to help you find the most relevant products among the thousands available on our platform. It is based on a combination of algorithms and criteria that are continuously refined to ensure an optimized shopping experience.

11.1.1 Key Parameters Influencing Rankings

*   **Relevance to Search Query:**
    
    Our system prioritizes products that match your search terms or browsing behavior. This includes assessing product titles, descriptions, product images and categories for alignment with your input, your filters, your categories, your sorting.
    
*   **Popularity:**
    
    Products that are frequently purchased, highly rated, or often viewed by other customers may rank higher, as these indicators suggest customer satisfaction and interest.
    
*   **Personalization:**
    
    If you are logged into your account, our system may use your browsing history, purchase history, and preferences (e.g., size, style) to tailor the ranking to your interests.
    
*   **Price:**
    
    While all price ranges are represented, the system may highlight products that align with your historical preferences and/or current promotions.
    
*   **Promotions and Sponsored Content:**
    
    Products that are part of special promotions or are sponsored by sellers may be given higher visibility. Sponsored listings are clearly labeled as such to ensure transparency.
    
*   **Availability:**
    
    Products in stock and available for immediate purchase are prioritized to enhance your shopping experience.
    
*   **Sustainability Indicators:**
    
    Products meeting certain sustainability criteria, such as eco-friendly materials or production methods, may be given preference if you have shown interest in such attributes.
    
*   **Country:**
    
    Which version of the Zalando Shop you are visiting might have an influence on which products are available to you.
    

11.1.2. **How parameters interact**: The relative importance of these parameters can vary based on the context of your search or browsing session. Most relevant parameters are the country, item information, the selection of filters and sorting, e.g. favoured sizes, and the popularity of items as well as preferences, purchases and browsing activities. Below, we provide an overview of how our ranking works, including the key parameters and their interplay that influence the order in which products are displayed to you:

*   **Search Relevance First:**
    
    If you perform a specific search query, relevance to that query will be weighted most heavily, while other parameters such as popularity or personalization will play a secondary role.
    
*   **Personalization Priority:**
    
    When browsing without a specific query, your previous interactions with the platform will influence the ranking, alongside product popularity and availability.
    
*   **Promotion Influence:**
    
    Sponsored content and promotions are integrated into the ranking with a balanced approach, ensuring that they do not overshadow organic results that match your interests.
    

11.1.3 **Transparency and User Control:** We are committed to providing you with a transparent shopping experience. To this end:

*   **Sponsored Content Labeling:**
    
    Sponsored products are clearly marked with a label to differentiate them from organically ranked items.
    
*   **Sorting Options:**
    
    You can override the default ranking by using sorting options such as “Price: Low to High”, “Customer Ratings”, or “Newest First” to tailor the product order to your preferences.
    
*   **Personalization Settings:**
    
    You can manage your personalization preferences or choose to browse anonymously by adjusting your account settings.
    

11.1.4 **Algorithmic Monitoring and Updates:** To ensure fairness and relevance, our recommender system is monitored and updated regularly. We conduct rigorous testing to identify potential biases and continuously improve the algorithm to align with your needs and expectations.  
11.1.5 **Managing your preferences:** The respective parameters for an individual recommender system can be accessed via the "info-i" symbol on the recommender system, for example on the catalogue page. The following link will provide you with further information on the profile information we use and the possibility of influencing the use their use for the recommender systems on the entire platform:
