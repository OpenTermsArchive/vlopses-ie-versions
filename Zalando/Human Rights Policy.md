**Why does Zalando have Ethical Standards?**
--------------------------------------------

The fashion industry has endemic problems when it comes to human rights and social standards. Because of our size and reach, we see it as our responsibility to lead the way in creating a more ethical fashion industry. This means laying out clear standards for our own company as well as business partners, and fostering meaningful collaborations to create the change we want to see. We also want our customers to know that the goods we sell and procure have been produced in an ethical, safe and environmentally conscious manner. 

**What are Zalando's Ethical Standards?**
-----------------------------------------

There are four policies that make up Zalando’s Ethical Standards: 

1.  **Code of Conduct:** This policy outlines the standards to which we hold ourselves and our business partners accountable, in the areas of Human Rights and Labour Rights, Environmental Protection, Fair and Ethical Business Practices, Monitoring and Complaints.
    
2.  **Sustainable Sourcing and Animal Welfare Policy:** This policy defines minimum requirements for the use of specific fibres, materials and manufacturing methods, along with the principles to which all partners must adhere when supplying products made from animal-derived materials for sale through Zalando, with the aim to support the transition to a fair, more sustainable and circular economy. 
    
3.  **Product, Content and Brand Guidelines:** This policy defines what Zalando considers to be offensive, illegal or otherwise inappropriate products and content, and acts as a reference point when making decisions regarding what types of products and content are allowed to be sold or posted on the platform. 
    
4.  **Zalando’s Human Rights strategy**: This policy highlights our commitment to respecting human rights across our value chain and sets expectations and requirements for all of our business partners. It outlines our human rights risk priorities for the year, our approach to managing these risks, and how we monitor and communicate their progress.

Introduction: Our commitment to respecting human rights



Zalando is committed to respecting and supporting the dignity and wellbeing of our1

employees, the workers in our value chain, the communities where we operate and thoseaffected by our operations.



We are committed to meeting our responsibility to respect human rights as referred to inthe German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz) and asdefined by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We support theprinciples contained within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Socialand Cultural Rights and the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Declaration onFundamental Principles and Rights at Work.



At Zalando, we want to build and strengthen lasting and robust partnerships. It isimportant to us that all stakeholders – customers, employees and Business Partners –experience Zalando as an organization that values human and labor rights, ethicalbusiness conduct, diversity and inclusion, and our planet as a whole. We also believe thatintegrity and transparency are the foundation of a healthy business culture.



This Human Rights Policy sets out the overarching principles to respecting and managinghuman rights due diligence which we embed into our operating standards andmanagement practices. In addition to this policy we communicate our expectationstowards ethical business conduct through the internal Code of Ethics and through the2

Code of Conduct , which is part of our contractual agreements with our Business3

Partners. Zalando adheres to all laws and regulations that apply through the markets itoperates in and countries needed for its operations. Where there are conflicts ordifferences between internationally recognised human rights standards and national laws,we will adopt processes that seek ways to honor the higher of the two standards.



3 The Code of Conduct is particularly focused on labor rights and workplace health andsafety. It is supported by other relevant policies which include the Sustainable SourcingPolicy, the Forest Protection Policy and the Restricted Substance List, Social Standardsand Product \& Content Guidelines

Scope: Who does this apply to?



This Human Rights Policy applies to all Zalando operations, the entities that it owns, theentities in which it holds a majority interest and facilities operated on behalf of Zalando.Furthermore, this Human Rights Policy specifies the expectations and requirementsZalando has towards all Business Partners in its supply chain including suppliers,service providers, platform partners, distributors, consultants, agents and subcontractors.



At Zalando we expect our Business Partners and other parties whose own impacts maybe directly linked to our operations, products or services to respect and not infringe uponhuman rights and environmental rights that directly affect the wellbeing of workers. Wewill not tolerate or condone abuse of human rights within any part of our business orvalue chain. We will take any allegations that human rights are not properly respectedseriously and investigate potential or actual human rights violations to act accordingly.This process is supported by ongoing engagement and collaboration with ourstakeholders.



Priorities: What do we focus on?



Our human rights risk management approach prioritizes salient human rights issues,identified through our due diligence efforts and our risk analysis and assessment process.4



Zalando is committed to respect all human rights. However, we recognise that somerights are at greater risk than others due to the specific nature of Zalando’s operations inthe industries of fashion, retail and logistics. The annual human rights risk assessmentanalyzes supplier risk based on country, industry and spend regarding a variety of humanrights and to a limited extent environment-related risk with direct effect on humanwellbeing. Our priority human rights related risks are:



● Protecting the right to equal treatment \- especially regarding the rights ofminorities, women and girls and young workers;

● The rights to decent working conditions including working hours and anadequate wage as laid down by the applicable law and regulations of the place ofemployment; and

● Preventing modern slavery in Zalando’s operations and supply chain.



We recognise that the nature of risks can evolve over time and that changes to businessoperations can impact the saliency of the priority human rights issues that we mustaddress which is why the priority risks are re-evaluated annually. Based on our annualrisk assessment and analysis, results reflected that our priority risk areas remained thesame as last year.

Approach: How do we implement risk management?



We are committed to conducting risk-based human rights due diligence across our supplychain on an ongoing basis, in accordance with the recommendations set out in theOECD’s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. Our due diligenceapproach is adjusted to take into account operational context and risk, businessrelationships and the extent to which we may cause, contribute to or be directly linked toadverse human rights impacts. We seek to track the effectiveness of our responses andinterventions. Further, we take both feedback, as well as qualitative and quantitativeindicators from internal and external sources into account.



The human rights risk management at Zalando is defined in the Human Rights DueDiligence Program. In line with industry standards it is divided into 5 high-level steps:



1. Govern: Define and embed human rights standards and expectations in ouroperations and value chain, clearly communicate them to all stakeholders usingthe most appropriate channels and monitor program effectiveness;

2. Analyze: Identify and analyze supplier risk based on volume, location andindustry-specific human rights risks;

3. Prioritize: Prioritize sector and supplier risk based on risk analysis and risk profileto define corresponding risk management measures;

4. Manage: Ensure that standards and expectations are met and implementpreventive, remedial and mitigating measures;

5. Report: Publicly disclose efforts and progress in line with Zalando’s ownstandards and legal requirements.



The individual elements are implemented through respective programs, frameworks andprocesses.



Furthermore we are committed to providing employees, Business Partners and any otherinternal or external stakeholder with appropriate grievance mechanisms . We seek to5

build awareness and knowledge of our employees and Business Partners on humanrights issues, encouraging them to speak up, without retribution and - if desired -anonymously, about any concerns they may have.
