1\. Purpose and Area of Application



The purpose of our Product and Brand Guidelines is to set clear standards of1 2

what is not permissible for the products made available to our customers andthe brands we partner with. We also have strict standards for what kind of

content we allow on the platform - the Community Guidelines. Zalando’s

community guidelines apply to all content on Zalando, including brands,partners, users and content creators, ensuring content aligns with the platform'svalues of safety, inclusivity, respect, and quality.



2 Brand refers to a Business Partner’s conduct and principles including but not limited to:name, image, background history, and marketing practices.



1 Product refers to all goods made available to our customers on any Zalando platform.

The Product \& Brand Guidelines (or PB Guidelines) are complementary to our

Code of Conduct and other sustainability and ethical standards, which set the

baseline for social, environmental and chemical compliance, and apply to allBusiness Partners, including, but not limited to: suppliers, agents and tradingcompanies (hereinafter “Business Partners”) of Zalando SE and all itssubsidiaries (hereinafter “Zalando”). The PB Guidelines explain what Zalandoconsiders offensive, illegal, or inappropriate for products, and brands to sell onthe Zalando platform. They help Zalando employees and our Business Partnersdecide what is not allowed to be sold on our platform. This applies to everythingsold or shown on Zalando's websites, including product names, descriptions,images, videos, and logos. It also applies when we choose brand partners. Forexample, if a brand's name, logo, or marketing violates these guidelines, thatbrand is not a good fit for Zalando. We also check a brand's history for anyviolations (e.g., discrimination, misconduct by leaders).



Please note that the guidance provided here is to support any team or employeebuying, selecting and/ or working with displaying and purchasing products andbrands to sell / offer on Zalando. While we recognise that style and clothing (i.e.our products) can change its meaning over time - particularly with changingsocial movements and global context - Zalando will continue to prohibit the saleof any product or brand which has any association with any of the outlineddimensions in section 2.



The PB Guidelines do not include an exhaustive list of use cases. Productproducers, along with those choosing and selecting brand partners, areexpected to make the required and necessary judgements when applying the PBGuidelines to ensure that products and brands displayed on Zalando meet ourrequirements and represent our values. Both employees of Zalando and of ourBusiness Partners are required to familiarize themselves with the PB Guidelines

in accordance with the Zalando Platform Rules (3.7 Compliance with Zalando’s

Sustainability Requirements \& Ethical Guidelines) . In the case that a product orbrand in question cannot be fully assessed by the PB Guidelines, please refer toour internal escalation process explained in Chapter 4.



In addition to ongoing compliance checks carried out during delivery andproduction, Zalando’s Quality Assurance performs regular spot-checks on theproduct assortment to verify Business Partners’ compliance with the PBGuidelines specified below.



Products and brands on Zalando may be flagged as being in violation of the PBGuidelines by various sources, including, but not limited to: buyers, customers,or campaigning groups. Products or brands that are considered to be in violationof the PB Guidelines will not be displayed on Zalando - if already live, the

In case of a violation(s), remediation andcorrective action plans will be designed (based on the severity) in collaborationwith Business Partners to prevent additional violations. Further, Zalando reservesthe right to suspend Business Partners from selling on the platform or terminatethe business relationship, if they violate the PB guidelines and the legalrequirements for such termination under applicable law(s).

Sustainable Sourcing \& Animal Welfare Policy



3\. Animal Welfare Principles

Sustainable Sourcing \& Animal Welfare Policy

3\. Animal Welfare Principles



● Zalando does not permit animals to be killed solely for the purpose of fashion. We believe that killing animals solely for the purposes of fashion products isunnecessary. Zalando does not sell fur and has been part of the Fur Free Retailer program since 2016. Animal-derived materials may only be used in productssold on any Zalando platform under the conditions listed below.

● Zalando is against the sale of products made from wild animals. These include materials derived from wild-caught animals and wild animals reared in farmingenvironments, particularly those species classified as vulnerable or endangered, which appear on either the International Union for the Conservation of Nature(IUCN) or the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) checklists.

● Zalando is against animal testing. No cosmetics/beauty products sold on Zalando may be tested on animals, in accordance with the EU ban that came intoeffect on 11 March 2013.

● Zalando requires all Business Partners selling animal-derived products to promote good animal welfare throughout their supply chains. We encourage allBusiness Partners to establish and implement their own Animal Welfare policies, which adopt the Five Domains Model and according Five Provisions and AlignedAnimal Welfare Aims designed to assess and encapsulate both the physical and mental state of animals. We commit to strive for the same level of Animal Welfarewithin our Private Label supply chain, and to understand and reduce confinement, body alterations and journey times, whilst improving enrichment provisionacross the supply chains. We believe that animals should be pre-stunned at slaughter and are committed to supporting One Health approach to antimicrobialresistance.

● Zalando does not permit the use of live animals in photoshoots. Business Partners using animal imagery in marketing materials should ensure imagery used issensitive to animal welfare issues.

● Zalando is committed to increasing traceability and transparency across our supply chain and the industry as a whole. We acknowledge that progress inimplementing our Animal Welfare Policy can only be achieved where Business Partners have systems in place to trace back to the source of primary productionwithin their supply chains. We expect all Business Partners to provide key sourcing information as standard about the animal-derived materials they use, includingthe name of the species of animal (common and Latin), country of origin where applicable (where the animal was reared and slaughtered), and any relevantdocumentation showing proof of good animal welfare or compliance of materials.

● Zalando is committed to increasing the amount of sustainably-sourced materials, including those from animal-derived sources. We are committed toleading by example; Zalando’s own Private Labels are certified to Textile Exchange's Responsible Animal Fibre Standards; and we expect our Business Partners tofollow by implementing robust certification systems for animal-derived materials and fibres. We also encourage and support the innovation of plant-basedalternatives to animal-derived products. We will provide information on our progress towards sourcing more sustainable materials in our annual public reporting.

4.0 Use of Voluntary Customer-facing Green Claims

Sustainable Sourcing \& Animal Welfare Policy

4\. Use of Voluntary Customer-facing Green Claims



Zalando encourages Business Partners to develop robust product sustainability and materials strategies, going beyond the minimum sourcingrequirements outlined in this policy, including the use of materials, ingredients and third party certification schemes which support environmental, ethicaland animal welfare improvements.

Consumers are also increasingly demanding products which minimise harm to the environment and the workers producing the products they buy.

Therefore, Zalando encourages Business Partners to consider developing products which fulfill our voluntary Sustainability Product Standards.When the relevant product data is shared with Zalando and the criteria are fulfilled, the products will have sustainability-related attributes (e.g. recycledmaterial, organic material, etc) displayed in our digital experience.

4\. Use of Voluntary Customer-facing Green Claims



In parallel, environmental legislation in Europe is tightening, setting a higher bar for the industry toward better practices and improved transparency forcustomers. Therefore, Business Partners must ensure that they have the necessary documentation to evidence any sustainability-related claimsthey would like to make on Zalando. This includes, but is not limited to product claims and all forms of sustainability-related messaging. BusinessPartners may be requested to share evidence documentation for their sustainability-related claims, and Zalando reserves the right to removesustainability-related claims from the platform if they are found to be inaccurate or misleading.



We expect Business Partners to adhere to our Sustainability Communication Policy and guidelines, as well as applicable national andinternational regulations. The communications and messaging displayed on our platform, whether created by Zalando or our Business Partners, shouldbe based on a fair and transparent description of products and services, including verifiable data which reflect the unique qualities and features of eachproduct. Any form of exaggeration while communicating social and environmental performance is firmly rejected.

**Our approach**
----------------

At Zalando, we want to build and strengthen solid and aspirational partnerships. It is important to us that all stakeholders – customers, employees and partners – experience Zalando as an organisation that values human and labour rights, ethical standards, compliance with the law, diversity and inclusion, and our planet as a whole. We also believe that integrity, respect and transparency are the foundation of a healthy business culture. As we continue to raise the bar for ourselves and our partners, we will hold ourselves accountable to these standards, and expect our partners to conduct themselves in line with this Code of conduct as well.

**To whom does the Code of conduct apply?** 
--------------------------------------------

This Code of conduct applies to all partners – including suppliers, service providers, platform partners, distributors, consultants and agents Zalando. Beyond that, we challenge our partners to take additional steps to improve conditions within their own value chain. In some cases, and depending on the industry, Zalando has issued more detailed guidance on ethical standards which we additionally expect partners to comply with. 

**Our expectations**
--------------------

This Code of conduct provides principles to guide Zalando and our partners in our joint effort to grow our businesses in a fair and sustainable way globally. We expect our partners not only to comply with these guidelines, but to strive towards ambitious improvement beyond compliance with regulatory obligations. We also urge our partners to integrate these standards throughout their own value chain, and to observe best-practice minimums for all individuals, from the fields to the corporate offices. The obligations outlined in this Code of conduct are based on international standards, including ILO Conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and we encourage all partners to move towards best practice.

You can find the latest version of our Code of conduct attached to this article and available to download.
