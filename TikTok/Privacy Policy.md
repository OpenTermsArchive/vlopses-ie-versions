**Introduction**
----------------

This privacy policy ("**Privacy Policy**") applies to the personal information that TikTok processes in connection with TikTok apps, websites, software and related services (the “**Platform**”), that link to or reference this Privacy Policy. **Data Controller**: If you live in the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), the United Kingdom (“**UK**”), or Switzerland, TikTok Technology Limited, an Irish company (“**TikTok Ireland**”), and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (“**TikTok UK**”), a UK company, ("**TikTok**," "**our**," "**we**," or "**us**") are the joint controllers of your information processed in connection with this Privacy Policy.

**What Information We Collect**
-------------------------------

We collect your information in three ways: [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide), [Automatically Collected Information](#auto-collect-info), and [Information From Other Sources](#info-from-other). More detail is provided below.

### **Information You Provide**

*   **Account Information.** We collect information that you provide when you set up an account, such as your date of birth, username, email address and/or telephone number, and password. You can choose to add other information to your account, such as a bio or image.
*   **User Content.** We collect the content you create, import, upload or publish through the Platform, such as photographs, videos, audio recordings, livestreams, comments, hashtags, feedback, reviews, and the associated metadata (such as when, where, and by whom the content was created). Even if you are not a user, information about you may appear in content created or published by users on the Platform. We collect [User Content](#user-content) through pre-loading at the time of creation, import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or upload that [User Content](#user-content), for example, to recommend music based on the video. We also collect content (such as text, images, and video) from your device's clipboard if you choose to copy and paste content to or from the Platform or share content between it and a third party platform. In addition, we collect location information (such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest) if you choose to add the location information to your [User Content](#user-content).
*   **Messages.** We collect the content of the messages you send and receive on the Platform and the associated metadata (such as the time the message was sent, received or read, as well as the participants in the communication). We also collect the messages you send or receive through our chat functionality when using our shopping feature to communicate with sellers or using virtual assistants.
*   **Your Contacts and Other Connections.** If you choose to sync your contacts, we will collect information from your device’s phone book such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses, and match that information to users of the Platform. If you choose to find other users through your social network contacts, we will collect your public profile information as well as names and profiles of your social network contacts. We also collect information about the accounts you follow and that follow you.
*   **Purchase Information.** When you make a purchase, a payment, or other transaction on or through the Platform, including when you buy TikTok Coins or purchase products through our shopping features, we collect information about the transaction, such as payment card information, billing, delivery, and contact information, and products you purchased.
*   **Surveys, Research, and Promotions.** We collect [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide) if you choose to participate in a survey, research, promotion, contest, marketing campaign, or event conducted or sponsored by us.
*   **Information When You Contact Us.** When you contact us, we collect the information you send us, such as proof of identity or age, feedback or inquiries about your use of the Platform or information about possible violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service) (our “**Terms**”), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines) (our “**Guidelines**”), or other policies.
*   **Information From Forms and Features You Use**. We collect the [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide) when you fill in a form on the Platform. You can let TikTok fill in forms automatically with your account info, like your addresses or payment info.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

*   **Technical Information.** We collect certain device and network connection information when you access the Platform. This information includes your device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, system language and device settings. We also collect service-related, diagnostic, performance information, including crash reports and performance logs. We automatically assign you a device ID and user ID. Where you log-in from multiple devices, we use information such as your device ID and user ID to identify your activity across devices to give you a seamless log-in experience and for security purposes.
*   **Location Information.** We automatically collect information about your approximate location (e.g. country, state, or city) based on your [Technical Information](#tech-info) (such as SIM card and IP address). Also, where you enable location services for the TikTok app within your device settings, we collect approximate or precise location information from your device. Click [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/location-services-on-tiktok) to learn more about how we collect Location Information.
*   **Usage Information.** We collect information about how you engage with the Platform, including information about how you interact with content and ads, the duration and frequency of your use, your engagement with other users, and your search history. _We also collect information about your interactions with websites when you use our in-app browser._
*   **Content Characteristics and Features.** We detect and collect characteristics and features about the videos, images, and audio recordings that are part of your [User Content](#user-content), for example, by identifying objects and scenery, the existence or location within an image of a face or other body parts; and the text of words spoken in your [User Content](#user-content). We do this, for example, for content moderation and to provide special effects (such as video filters and avatars) and captions.
*   **Inferred Information.** We infer your attributes (such as age-range and gender) and interests based on the information we have about you. We use inferences, for example, to keep the Platform safe (such as for content moderation), to show you relevant information, and, where permitted, to serve you personalised ads based on your interests.
*   **Cookies.** We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to operate and provide the Platform. For example, we use cookies to remember your language preferences, make sure you don’t see the same video more than once, and for security purposes. We also use these technologies for marketing purposes. To learn more about our use of cookies, please see our [Cookies Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/tiktok-website-cookies-policy). We will obtain your consent to our use of cookies where required by law.

### **Information From Other Sources**

*   **Advertising, Measurement and Other Partners.** Advertisers, measurement and other partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of the Platform, such as your activities on other websites and apps or in stores, including the products or services you purchased, online or in person. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Platform with your TikTok account. Some of our advertisers and other partners enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our [TikTok Advertiser Tools](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000407) (such as TikTok Pixel). These partners are required to have the necessary rights and permissions to share your information with us before doing so. We process certain information that we receive from these partners as a joint controller with them. [Learn more](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/business-products-terms) about our arrangements with these partners.
*   **Sellers, Payment and Transaction Fulfillment Providers.** We receive information about you from sellers as well as payment and transaction fulfillment providers, such as payment confirmation details, and information about the delivery of products you have purchased through our shopping features.
*   **Third Party Platforms and Partners.** Third party platforms provide us with information (such as your email address, authentication ID, and public profile) when you choose to sign up for or log in to the Platform using sign-in features provided by those third parties. We may also receive contact information that you hold or is held about you when contact information is synced with our Platform by you or another user. When you interact with any third party service (such as third party apps, websites or products) that integrate [TikTok Developer Tools](https://developers.tiktok.com/), we will receive the information necessary to provide you with features like cross-service authentication or cross-posting. For example, this will happen if you log in to another platform with your TikTok account or if you use TikTok’s “share” button on a third party platform to share content from there to the Platform. We may also receive information from third party providers which we use for safety purposes, including to protect users on the Platform and for content moderation.
*   **Additional Sources.** We may collect or receive information about you from organisations, businesses, people, and others, including, for example, publicly available sources, government authorities, professional organisations, and charity groups. We also collect information about you where you are included or mentioned in [User Content](#user-content), [Messages](#message), in a complaint, appeal, request or feedback submitted by a user or third party, or if your contact information is provided to us by a user.

**Data Security and Retention**
-------------------------------

Security of your information is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical, administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorised access, theft, disclosure, modification, or loss. We regularly review our security measures to consider available new technology and methods.

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Platform and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing the Platform, and enhancing its safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defence of legal claims.

The retention periods will be different depending on the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information. For example, when we process your information to provide you with the Platform, we keep this information for as long as you have an account. This information includes your [Account Information](#account-info), [User Content](#user-content), and [Messages](#message). If you violate our Guidelines or Terms, we may remove [Information You Provide](#info-you-provide) including your [Account Information](#account-info) and/or [User Content](#user-content) from public view immediately but keep your information as is necessary to process the violation.

**Our Global Operations and Data Transfers**
--------------------------------------------

To support our global operations:

*   We store the information described in the “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” section in servers located in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore.
*   Certain entities in our Corporate Group, located outside your country of residence (see [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/transferee-countries/en)), are given limited remote access to this information so they can provide certain functions, as described in the Our Corporate Group section in “[How We Share Your Information](#share-info)”. This access is limited, secure and only granted where necessary under strict security controls and authorisation approval protocols.
*   We share “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” with service providers, partners and other third party entities, as described in “[How We Share Your Information](#share-info)”. These third parties can be located outside your country of residence.

These entities commit to processing information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security measures to protect your information.

When we transfer your information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

*   Adequacy decisions. These are decisions from the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/transferee-countries/en); or
*   Article 49. In the absence of an adequacy decision, We rely on Article 49 (1)(b) and (c) GDPR to transfer [Purchase Information](https://bytedance.sg.larkoffice.com/docx/IABcdmCZGoOq4WxMgHQlH1CBgQd#share-RrVCdnNjYoFcTOxgVDqljZFSg4b) as described in “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” to sellers and transaction fulfilment providers in countries without an adequacy decision when necessary to provide shopping features to facilitate the purchase and delivery of products, goods and services, or to process your orders; or
*   Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved [contractual clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e60b1cd4-d802-44d5-9cac-ddd3c943a5ef_en?filename=1_en_annexe_acte_autonome_cp_part1_v5_0.pdf) under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “[What Information We Collect](#info-collected)” to certain entities in our Corporate Group (as described [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/transferee-countries/en)) and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.

For a copy of these adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, please contact us via the details provided in the “[Contact us](#contact-us)” section below.

Children's Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 1, 2024_

  

_For Children_
--------------

TikTok cares about your privacy. Children under the age of 13 in the United States can use TikTok in the Under 13 Experience (“Kids Mode”). When you use Kids Mode, we collect some information from you. This page explains what information we get and how we use it.

### **What Information Do We Collect from You?**

When you use TikTok, we collect some information about you. For example, when you set up a TikTok account, we collect your birthday, username, and password. We also collect some information from your phone, tablet, or other device you use, such as information about what kind of device you have, and information about the videos you watch. If you contact us with feedback or questions, we may collect your email address so that we can respond to you.

### **How Do We Use Your Information?**

We use your information to allow you to use and enjoy TikTok. For example, we use your username and password to let you access your account. We may use information about what videos you watch to show you additional videos that we think you’ll enjoy. We use information about your device to keep TikTok running smoothly.

### **How Do We Share Your Information?**

We may share your information with companies that provide support to TikTok.

We may share your information to keep you or others safe. We may also share your information to keep TikTok safe, protect our rights, and comply with law. We don’t sell your information or share it to target ads based on your activity across the services of different businesses.

### **How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?**

We have appropriate security protections to help keep your information safe. These protections help stop others from stealing your information or using it in bad ways. But online security is never perfect, so be careful when using online services.

### **Where and How Long Do We Keep Your Information?**

Some of your information may be kept outside the U.S. How long we keep your information depends on several things, such as the type of information and the reason why we collected the information. In general, we only keep your information as long as we need it.

### **What Rights Do You Have?**

You have the right to know, access, correct or delete your information. You can submit a request at [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy) or by sending your request to the address provided in the “[Contact Us](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en#contactus)” section below. Depending on where you live, your parent or guardian can also make these requests for you. If you, or your parent or guardian, do make such a request, we will respond appropriately and will not penalize you for it.

### **Do You Ever Update This Privacy Policy?**

Yes, we may update this page from time to time, so please check back.

### **What If I Have Questions or Need More Information?**

For more information, please review the rest of this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian.

**_For Parents, Guardians, and Other Adults_**
----------------------------------------------

TikTok Inc. (“TikTok”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of children. This Children’s Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the personal information of users under the age of 13 (“Children”) on a separate experience of the TikTok services for Children in the United States (“Kids Mode”).

Kids Mode is designed for Children residing in the United States. It allows Children to engage with TikTok’s fun video features while limiting the information collected from them. Children can view videos from other creators and explore their creativity by capturing their own videos with music and special effects. While Children may save these videos directly to their device, the videos will not be collected by us or viewable by other users. Children also have a more limited interactive experience, including, for example, they cannot exchange messages with other users, and other users cannot view their profiles.

### **What Information We Collect from Children**

When a Child registers for TikTok, we collect only limited information, including username, password, and birthday.

We may also collect certain information automatically from the Child’s device, including internet or other network activity information such as device ID, IP address, web browser type and version, country-level location, as well as certain app activity information, such as video watches, time in the app, and general usage information.

If a Child reaches out to us via the in-app feedback form, we collect the email address that the Child provides solely for the purpose of responding to the inquiry.

While certain information we collect from children and subsequently use and disclose may constitute sensitive personal information under applicable state privacy laws, we only process such information in order to provide the Platform and within other exemptions under applicable law.

### **How We Use Children’s Information**

We use the information we collect to provide and support our services. For example, we use username and password to authenticate Children. We may use the information that is collected automatically to provide personalized content; serve contextual advertising; perform analytics and troubleshoot; protect the security and integrity of the user and our services; and ensure legal and regulatory compliance.

Children cannot publicly share personal information, including videos or profile information.

We do not engage in profiling which results in legal or similarly significant effects, as defined under applicable law.

### **How We Share Children’s Information**

We may share the information that we collect with our corporate group or service providers as necessary for them to support the internal operations of the TikTok service.

We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law (i) in response to a court order or a subpoena, or similar legal process; (ii) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (iii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, to facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of Children using our sites or applications; (iv) to protect the security and integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (v) to enable us to take precautions against liability.

TikTok does not sell information from Children to third parties and does not share such information with third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.

### **Data Security and Retention**

We make efforts to treat Children’s information securely and in accordance with this policy. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we take steps to protect this information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the TikTok services; any transmission is at the user’s own risk.

We employ technical and organizational measures designed to achieve a level of security appropriate to risks of varying likelihood and severity and that takes into the account the rights and freedoms of users. We maintain these technical and organizational measures and will amend them from time to time to maintain or improve the overall security of our systems.

We retain Children’s information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected. The retention periods are different depending on different criteria, such as the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information.

TikTok may transmit Children’s information to its servers or data centers outside of the United States for storage and/or processing. Other entities with whom TikTok may share Children’s information as described herein may be located outside of the United States.

### **Your Rights**

A parent or guardian may submit a request to access or delete the information of their Child, as well as a request to appeal a decision we have made about such a request, by contacting us via the webform or the physical address provided in the Contact Us section below.

Depending on your state of residence, you (as a parent or guardian) may have the ability to exercise certain rights over your Child's account. For example, you may download account data or exercise other rights in connection with your Child by contacting us via the webform or physical address provided in the Contact Us section below. We will address these requests in accordance with applicable law and subject to proper validation.

### **Privacy Policy Updates**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we update the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of the new Privacy Policy, posting the new Privacy Policy, or providing any other notice required by applicable law. We recommend that you review the Privacy Policy each time you visit TikTok’s services to stay informed of our privacy practices.

*   Contact us: [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy)

TikTok Ad Network Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 30 November 2025

  

This TikTok Ad Network Privacy Policy applies to the personal information that TikTok processes in connection with the TikTok Ad Network in the UK.

If you are a TikTok User (see below), see the TikTok Privacy Policy for information about how TikTok processes personal information in connection with your TikTok Account (see below).

**Data Controller:** TikTok Technology Limited, an Irish company (“**TikTok Ireland**”), and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (“**TikTok UK**”), a UK company, ("**TikTok**," "**our**," "**we**," or "**us**") are the joint controllers of your information processed in connection with this [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy).

  

**What is the TikTok Ad Network?**
----------------------------------

The TikTok Ad Network is a mobile advertising network, including support systems and services, operated by TikTok (described below as “**TTAN**”). TTAN works with third parties (described below as “**Publishers**”) who want to sell advertising space on mobile applications that they own or operate or otherwise have the right to serve advertising on (“**Publisher Apps**”). TTAN connects these Publishers with advertisers who wish to deliver advertising on Publisher Apps. TTAN provides reporting to:

*   advertisers - to enable them to understand the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns on Publisher Apps; and
*   Publishers - to enable them to understand the performance of their advertising space.

Advertisements delivered to Publisher Apps through TTAN are shown to:

*   users holding a TikTok account (“**TikTok Users**” with a “**TikTok Account**”); and
*   individuals who are not TikTok Users.

TikTok participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework in respect of TTAN and complies with its Specifications and Policies.

**What information TTAN collects**
----------------------------------

We collect your information in three ways: [Information You Provide](##info), [Automatically Collected Information](##auto), [Information From Other Sources](##info-from). If you are a TikTok User, where permitted, we also use your [Information From Your TikTok Account](##info-tiktok-account). More detail is provided below.

### **Information You Provide**

*   **Information When You Contact Us.** When you contact us, or provide feedback, through forms, via email, or otherwise, we collect the information you send us.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

*   **Data from Publisher Apps.** When you interact with a Publisher App, we collect and process certain device and network information. We collect information automatically from your device using our software code (referred to as a “software development kit”, or “SDK”) which the Publisher has integrated into that Publisher App. We process device-specific identifiers such as mobile advertising identifiers (such as the "Google Advertising ID" on Android or the "ID for Advertisers" on iOS devices and similar) in order to create or match an identifier that is unique to your device. In addition, we also collect other information including your IP address, device model and price, operating system (i.e. iOS or Android) and version, internet service provider, mobile country code, mobile network code, mobile carrier, language settings, time zone, connection type (such as cellular or WIFI), connection speed (such as 4G or 5G), screen resolution, the time your device was last updated and started, as well as diagnostic performance information, including crash reports and performance logs. We also collect information about the privacy choices that you make on these Publisher Apps. We process information that we received from Publishers as a joint controller with them. [Learn more](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/business-products-terms) about our arrangements with these partners.
*   **Usage Information.** We collect information about your activity on Publisher Apps including the name of the Publisher App that has integrated TTAN and your interactions with any advertisements we deliver on Publisher Apps (e.g. information about the ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where and when the ad was served).
*   **Age-Range and Gender Information.** We assign an age range and gender to each user. We do not infer age range and gender based on personal information collected about you. Instead, we work this out using a mathematical formula that reflects the UK population overall.
*   **Location Information.** We determine your approximate location based on your IP address, mobile country code and mobile network code.

### **Information From Other Sources**

*   **Advertising and Measurement Partners.** Advertisers and measurement partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of Publisher Apps on advertiser websites and apps including the pages you visit, whether you download an app, and the products or services you purchased. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising which we use to help match you and your actions on advertiser websites and apps with your TTAN profile. Some of our advertisers and other partners enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our [TikTok Advertiser Tools](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-advertiser-tools-and-related-terms?redirected=1) (such as TikTok Pixel) - for more information, see [Cookies](##cookies). These partners are required to have the necessary rights and permissions to share your information with us before doing so. We process certain information that we receive from advertisers as a joint controller with them. [Learn more](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/business-products-terms) about our arrangements with these partners.

### **Information From Your TikTok Account**

*   Where you are a TikTok User we will access and use certain account related information connected to your TikTok Account in connection with TTAN (“**Account Data**”):

*   Whether your TikTok Account is associated with an under 18 or 18+ age status, as well as information about your privacy choices.
*   General location information from your TikTok Account.

*   Where you are a TikTok User, where permitted, we will also access and use certain additional information connected with your TikTok Account in connection with TTAN (“**Shared Data**”):

*   Inferred information associated with your TikTok Account, including inferred age-range, gender and interests.
*   Usage information, including how you interact with ads shown in your TikTok Account (e.g. clicks and views).
*   Information from advertisers and measurement partners (including via our [TikTok Advertiser Tools](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-advertiser-tools-and-related-terms?redirected=1)) about you and the actions you have taken on advertiser websites and apps connected with TikTok, including the pages you visit, whether you download and install an app, the products or services you purchased and other events.

  

**How We Use Your Information**
-------------------------------

We use your information in connection with TTAN as outlined below. You can find more detail in “[Our Legal Bases and How We Process Your Information](##our-legal)”.

*   Review, save and communicate your privacy choices.
*   To create personalised ads profiles and show you ads on Publisher Apps based on those profiles.
*   To limit the number of times an ad is shown to you and sequence the order in which ads are shown to you.
*   Create analytics reports so that advertisers can see how their ads are performing and better understand their audience, as well as to report to Publishers and ensure that we and our Publishers are paid accordingly.
*   Review, improve, and develop our services, including by monitoring interactions and usage, analysing how people are using the service, and by training, testing, and improving our technology, such as our machine learning models and algorithms.
*   Ensure the security of TTAN, detect and prevent fraud, and fix errors.
*   Comply with our legal obligations.
*   Protect TTAN and defend our legal rights and commercial interests, and those of our affiliates, Publishers, advertisers, other partners and the public.

  

**How We Share Your Information**
---------------------------------

### **Service Providers**

We engage service providers that help us provide, support, and develop TTAN and understand how it is used. They provide services such as: cloud hosting services, and fraud detection and brand safety support.

We share [Information You Provide](##info), [Automatically Collected Information](##auto), [Information From Other Sources](##info-from), and [Information From Your TikTok Account](##info-tiktok-account) with these service providers as necessary to enable them to provide their services.

### **Partners and Publishers**

**Advertisers.** We provide advertisers with information about the performance of their ads on Publisher Apps, including reports that help them measure their effectiveness and understand their audience. These reports contain aggregate information created from [Automatically Collected Information](##auto), [Information From Other Sources](##info-from), and [Shared Data](##shared-data).

**Measurement Partners.** We share [Automatically Collected Information](##auto) with third party measurement providers who create aggregate reports that help us measure advertising served on Publisher Apps and help our advertisers and Publishers understand their performance and their audience.

**Publishers.** We provide Publishers with reports about the performance of their ad space in order to help them understand performance. These reports contain aggregate information created from [Automatically Collected Information](##auto) and [Information From Other Sources](##info-from).

### **Our Corporate Group**

As a global company, TTAN is supported by certain entities within our corporate group (“**Corporate Group**”). These entities process [Information You Provide](##info), [Automatically Collected Information](##auto), [Information From Other Sources](##info-from), and [Information From Your TikTok Account](##info-tiktok-account) for us, as necessary to provide certain functions such as storage and technical support. For more information on Our Corporate Group, see [Global Operations and Data Transfers](##our).

### **Others**

We share your information in other limited scenarios as follows:

**Corporate Transactions.** Your information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, sale of assets or shares, reorganisation, financing, change of control, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business.

**Legal Obligations and Rights.** We may access, preserve, and share the information described in [What Information We Collect](##what) with law enforcement agencies, public authorities, or other third parties if we have good faith belief that it is necessary to comply with applicable law, legal process or government requests, as consistent with internationally recognised standards.

  

**Our Legal Bases and How We Process Your Information**
-------------------------------------------------------

We may only use your information when we have a “legal basis” to do so. We use different legal bases depending on why we use your information (in other words, the “purpose” of our processing). These legal bases are legitimate interests (ours, yours or those of another party), consent, and compliance with a legal obligation.

Here we explain the legal bases we rely on when we process your information. This section also describes why we use your information, how this information is processed, the categories of information involved, and the associated rights (which always includes the right to access your information). For more information on how to exercise any of your rights, please check out the “[Your Rights and Choices](##your-rights)” section below.

Publishers participating in TTAN will present you with a consent management platform within each Publisher App. These consent management platforms provide you with information about the purposes for which your data will be collected and used and allow us to establish a legal basis for those purposes.

To provide you with a familiar approach that aligns with best industry standards, Publishers are required to use a consent management platform that complies with the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework.

### **Legitimate Interests**

We use your information where this is necessary to achieve legitimate interests - whether belonging to us, you, or a third party - provided these interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. We use the information we collect to:

**Our Global Operations and Data Transfers**
--------------------------------------------

To support our global operations:

*   We store the information described in the “[What Information We Collect](##what)” section in servers located in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore.
*   Certain entities in our Corporate Group, located outside your country of residence (see below), are given limited remote access to the information described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)”, so they can provide certain functions, as described in the Our Corporate Group section in “How We Share Your Information”. This access is limited, secure and only granted where necessary under strict security controls and authorisation approval protocols.
*   We share “[What Information We Collect](##what)” with service providers, partners and other third party entities, as described in “How We Share Your Information”. These third parties can be located outside your country of residence.

These entities commit to processing information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security measures to protect your information.

When we transfer your information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

*   Adequacy decisions. These are decisions from the [UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation) or [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” to some countries with adequacy decisions. This includes where certain entities in our Corporate Group located in [Canada](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/2002/2\(1\)/oj/eng)**,** [Israel](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0061)**,** [Japan](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.076.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2019:076:TOC) and [South Korea](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/decision-adequate-protection-personal-data-republic-korea-annexes_en) are granted limited remote access to information described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” to provide important functions; or
*   Article 49. In the absence of an adequacy decision, we rely on Article 49 (1)(b) and (c) GDPR to transfer purchase information to sellers and transaction fulfilment providers in countries without an adequacy decision when necessary to provide shopping features to facilitate the purchase and delivery of products, goods and services, or to process your orders; or
*   Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved [contractual clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e60b1cd4-d802-44d5-9cac-ddd3c943a5ef_en?filename=1_en_annexe_acte_autonome_cp_part1_v5_0.pdf) under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the [UK](https://ico.org.uk/media2/migrated/4019539/international-data-transfer-addendum.pdf) and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” to certain entities in our Corporate Group and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision. This includes where we provide our Corporate Group entities in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore with the information described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” under standard contractual clauses so that they can store it on secure servers for us. It also includes where certain entities in our Corporate Group located in Australia, Brazil, China, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and the United States are granted, under standard contractual clauses, limited remote access to information described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” to provide important functions.

For a copy of these adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, please contact us via the details provided in the “[Contact us](##contact)” section below.
