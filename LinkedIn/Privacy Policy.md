2.  1\. Data We Collect
    -------------------
    
    ### 1.1 Data You Provide To Us
    
    You provide data to create an account with us.
    
    #### Registration
    
    To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, general location (e.g., city), and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.
    
    You create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services).
    
    #### Profile
    
    You have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit) about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, [city or area](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/38594?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), endorsements, and optional [verifications](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1359065/) of information on your profile (such as verifications of your identity or workplace). You don’t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to include [sensitive information](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/77?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.
    
    You may give other data to us, such as by syncing your calendar.
    
    #### Posting and Uploading
    
    We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services.
    
    If you sync your calendars with our Services, we will collect your calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.
    
    You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services.
    
    ### 1.2 Data From Others
    
    Others may post or write about you.
    
    #### Content and News
    
    You and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of [mentions in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    Others may sync their calendar with our Services
    
    #### Contact and Calendar Information
    
    We receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles.
    
    Customers and partners may provide data to us.
    
    #### Partners
    
    We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.
    
    #### Related Companies and Other Services
    
    We receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our [Affiliates](#key-terms-1), including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services

We use log-ins, cookies, [device information](#your-device-and-location) and internet protocol (“IP”) addresses to identify you and log your use.
    
    ### 1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies
    
    We collect data through cookies and similar technologies.
    
    As further described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy), we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a7154788). You can [opt out](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62931?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes.

We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.
    
    ### 1.6 Communications
    
    If you communicate through our Services, we learn about that.
    
    We collect information about you when you communicate with others through our Services (e.g., when you send, receive, or engage with messages, events, or connection requests, including our marketing communications). This may include information that indicates who you are communicating with and when. We also use [automated systems](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) to support and protect our site. For example, we use such systems to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or [Professional Community Policies](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    ### 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information
    
    When your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.
    
    Others buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “[LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a540854/?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en)” (formerly Company Page) administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.

    ### 1.9 Other
    
    We are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.
    
    Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.

3.  2\. How We Use Your Data
    ------------------------
    
    We use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.
    
    How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/). We may use your personal data to improve, develop, and provide products and Services, develop and train artificial intelligence (AI) models, develop, provide, and personalize our Services, and gain insights with the help of AI, automated systems, and inferences, so that our Services can be more relevant and useful to you and others. You can review LinkedIn's Responsible AI principles [here](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/member/trust-and-safety/responsible-ai-principles) and learn more about our approach to generative AI [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a5538339?hcppcid=search). [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1337820/) about the inferences we may make, including as to [your age and gender](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a517610/) and how we use them.
    
    ### 2.1 Services
    
    Our Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.
    
    We use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.
    
    #### Stay Connected
    
    Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
    
    We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
    
    It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can [choose](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/connections-visibility) whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
    
    Visitors have [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls) about how we use their data.
    
    #### Stay Informed
    
    Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain Members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/), we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a [social action](#key-terms-2), used a feature, made new connections or were [mentioned in the news](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50021?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    #### Career
    
    Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a [specific task](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fservices&data=05%7C01%7Cssundholm%40linkedin.com%7C7c195d34f8834cc0febd08daf458affa%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638090959000643494%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iBsm49Q3gx81BH3P1%2BaItfXuwKvskXVHMDr0gNAVm1s%3D&reserved=0)) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs and show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are [interested](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67405?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
    
    #### Productivity
    
    Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/) allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79855?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    
    ### 2.2 Premium Services
    
    Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content.
    
    We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-sharing). We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include [TeamLink](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/50216/teamlink-overview) and [LinkedIn Pages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a540854) (e.g., content analytics and followers).
    
    ### 2.3 Communications
    
    We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.
    
    We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication [preferences](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/messages) at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.
    
    We also enable [communications](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/137?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) between you and others through our Services, including for example [invitations](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/115?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), [InMail](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1584?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) and [messages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1645?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) between connections.
    
    ### 2.4 Advertising
    
    We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing non-personalized ads.
    
    We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:
    
    *   Data collected by advertising technologies on and off our Services using pixels, ad tags (e.g., when an advertiser installs a LinkedIn [tag](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a427660/) on their website), cookies, and other device identifiers;
    *   Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);
    *   Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;
    *   Information from advertising [partners](#key-terms-2), vendors and [publishers](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/85809?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en); and
    *   Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member). [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1337820/) about the inferences we make and how they may be used for advertising.
    
    [Learn more](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a426264/) about the ad technologies we use and our advertising services and partners. You can learn more about our compliance with laws in the Designated Countries or the UK in our [European Regional Privacy Notice](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy/eu).
    
    We will show you ads called [sponsored content](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/39575?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-visibility), if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.
    
    #### Ad Choices
    
    You have choices regarding our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. Member settings [can be found here](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads). For Visitors, [the setting is here](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls).
    
    #### Info to Ad Providers
    
    We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. We seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so where legally required, and in such instances, we take steps to ensure that consent has been provided before processing data from them.
    
    ### 2.5 Marketing
    
    We promote our Services to you and others.
    
    In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.
    
    ### 2.6 Developing Services and Research
    
    We develop our Services and conduct research
    
    #### Service Development
    
    We use data, including public feedback, to conduct [research](https://engineering.linkedin.com/ab-testing/xlnt-platform-driving-ab-testing-linkedin) and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.
    
    #### Other Research
    
    We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these [jobs](https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/february/3/introducing-the-linkedin-workforce-report) and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under [controls](https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/projects/economic-graph-research/economic-graph-details#data-privacy) that are designed to protect your privacy. We may also make public data available to [researchers](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6882244) to enable assessment of the safety and legal compliance of our Services. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.
    
    #### Surveys
    
    Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may [opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/research-invitations) of survey invitations.

4.  3\. How We Share Information
    ----------------------------
    
    ### 3.1 Our Services
    
    Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
    
    #### Profile
    
    Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third-party search tools). As detailed in our [Help Center](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/77?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their [usage of our Services](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.
    
    #### Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages
    
    Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.
    
    *   When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy)). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).
    *   In a [group](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), posts are visible to others according to group type. For example, posts in private groups are visible to others in the group and posts in public groups are visible publicly. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/197?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en).
    *   Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by those organizations and others who view those pages' content.
    *   When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.
    *   We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/71013?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) where applicable.
    *   Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47992?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en), we let a Member know when you view their profile. We also give you [choices](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6270863) about letting organizations know when you've viewed their Page.
    *   When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
    
    Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.
    
    #### Enterprise Accounts
    
    Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.
    
    Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy), when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.
    
    ### 3.2 Communication Archival
    
    Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.
    
    Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.
    
    ### 3.3 Others’ Services
    
    You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.
    
    Subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings?trk=d_flagship3_profile_self_view_public_profile), other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data (e.g., your name, title, and company) will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may [revoke](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/data-sharing-for-permitted-services) the link with such accounts.
    
    The information you make available to others in our Services (e.g., information from your profile, your posts, your engagement with the posts, or message to Pages) [may be available to them on other services](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1340507/). For example, search tools, mail and calendar applications, or talent and lead managers may show a user limited profile data (subject to your [settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/profile-visibility)), and social media management tools or other platforms may display your posts. The information retained on these services may not reflect updates you make on LinkedIn.
    
    ### 3.4 Related Services
    
    We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.
    
    We will share your personal data with our Affiliates to provide and develop our Services. For example, we may refer a query to Bing in some instances, such as where you'd benefit from a more up to date response in a chat experience. In regions outside the Designated Countries, we may also share your publicly-shared content (such as your public LinkedIn posts) with our Affiliates, including Microsoft, to provide or develop their services. [Where allowed](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6215608), we may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.
    
    ### 3.5 Service Providers
    
    We may use others to help us with our Services.
    
    We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, customer support, marketing and development). They will have access to your information (e.g., the contents of a customer support request) as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. If you purchase a Service from us, we may use a payments service provider who may separately collect information about you (e.g., for fraud prevention or to comply with legal obligations).
    
    ### 3.6 Legal Disclosures
    
    We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
    
    It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services or the products or services of our Affiliates (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our [Data Request Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/16880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en) and [Transparency Report](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency).
    
    ### 3.7 Change in Control or Sale
    
    We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    
    We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.

#### **Legitimate Interest**  

Where we rely on legitimate interests we balance the interests the processing supports against your rights and freedoms before processing your personal data, and you have the right to object or to ask for restriction of our processing we describe in this notice at any time.

#### **When does LinkedIn rely on legitimate interests?**

In some cases, the collection and processing of your personal data is based on our legitimate interests and/or the legitimate interests of third parties (e.g., LinkedIn customers and our Members), provided that our interest in processing does not outweigh your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. These interests include commercial interests, the interests of our Members and broader societal benefits. In each instance, we have considered whether these interests are outweighed by your rights and freedoms, and have concluded, based on the limited impact of the processing, the strong safeguards we apply, and the controls we offer you over your data, that we can proceed with the processing.  

If you have questions about how LinkedIn processes your personal data, you can view our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), the many articles and resources on our [Help Centre](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin) or you can [Contact us](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/solve).

#### **Data Sharing with Third Parties**

In addition to Section 3 of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), we have set our further information below on how LinkedIn may share your personal data for specific purposes with its partners, third-party service providers, customers, regulators and law enforcement agencies, other services such as online search result tools, and our Affiliates including our parent company, Microsoft, and other LinkedIn entities.

#### LinkedIn Developer Programs

Participants in LinkedIn’s Developer Programs can access limited Member personal data via LinkedIn’s Talent, Marketing, Sales and Learning Solutions APIs under our partnership agreements.

#### Third Party Service Providers

LinkedIn may also share your data with third-party service providers and processors. These include our parent company, Microsoft, cloud service providers, content delivery networks, telecommunications providers, maintenance providers, Member support providers, development service providers, market researchers, anti-fraud and anti-abuse services providers, marketing and analytics providers, payment processors, external auditors and advisors, managed services providers, consultancy and professional services firms, such as legal and tax advisors.

#### Regulators and Law Enforcement Agencies

In addition to the above, LinkedIn may also share your personal data with regulators and law enforcement agencies where it is required to do so by law. For more information on this, see section “**Compliance with Legal Obligations**” above.

#### Affiliates

_Our parent company_  

LinkedIn shares data with our parent company Microsoft, as set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) and this Notice, to combat harmful or fraudulent behaviour, to protect the security and integrity of our site and the services of Microsoft and others.  

_LinkedIn Entities_  

LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company shares personal data of all of our Members and Visitors with LinkedIn Corporation in the United States for processing and storage at our data centres, and may share certain personal data with other LinkedIn entities for the LinkedIn group’s business and security purposes.  

With other organisations for safety and security  

We may also share personal data in order to protect the security or integrity of our Services (e.g. sharing examples of security or safety threats with other companies facing similar threats), or the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, Visitors, and others.  

#### **How you can control your data**  

You can access, correct, rectify, delete your personal data, object to or ask us to restrict our processing or change your settings. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.

  
We offer a variety of ways for Members and Visitors to control their data. The easiest way to control how your data is processed if you are a Member is [via your account settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/account) and if you are a Visitor [via your Guest settings](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls). 

If you are a Visitor and you would like to contact LinkedIn about processing of your data or exercising the rights outlined in this section, you can reach out using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this [form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO).

Members can also object, correct inaccurate data, delete data, port data and in some cases restrict the use of their data as set out in this section:

#### **Accessing your data**

Members can access and download their data at any time. We will provide your data in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your [Member Settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy). You can learn more about how to download your data [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364?hcppcid=search)

#### **Correct and rectify your data**

When Members are signed in to our platform you can always review and update your profile information. You can also ask us to change, rectify or not use your data if it is not accurate. You can edit or correct most of your personal data at any time directly in your account settings. If there is any personal data not listed in your account settings that you would like to correct or update you can [complete a data rectification form.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DRF) You can learn more about how you can change or correct your personal data [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1336621).

#### **Deleting your data**

You can request that we delete your personal data. Most of your profile data can be deleted [through your account settings.](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/account) You can learn more about deleting your data [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1342613?hcppcid=search) For any data that cannot be deleted in your settings, you can submit a [Data Deletion request form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DDF). If you would like to delete all your personal data from LinkedIn, you can always choose to [close your account.](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/close-accounts)

#### **Restricting the use of your data** 

One of the ways you can restrict how your data is used is in your [Data Privacy settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy) and your [Advertising Data settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads). You can also request that processing of your data is restricted if the data is inaccurate or if you believe that the processing is unlawful by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or by using this [form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO). 

#### **Objecting to the use of your data** 

You also have the right to object to processing your data where legitimate interest or public interest is the legal basis for processing that data. To exercise your right to object you can contact us by using the details in the “Contact Us” Section below or complete our [Data Processing Objection form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO). 

Where you raise an objection, we will consider your request, our legal obligations, and whether we have a compelling interest in continuing to process your data. In certain cases, consistent with your legal rights and our obligations, we may not be able to fulfil your request—for example, we cannot stop processing your IP address when it is used to authenticate your login details, as this is a security measure that is essential to protect our site. In contrast, you can remove information about your education or work experience from your profile (although as a result, the job recommendations you receive may not be relevant to you) so that we don’t process it. 

Where we use your data for direct marketing (e.g. to send you marketing emails) or profiling for the purposes of direct marketing, you always have the right to object and we will stop using your data for this purpose.

#### **Portability** 

If we use your personal data to perform a contract with you, or with your consent, you have the right to receive your data and port it to another controller. You can download your data anytime in a structured readable format. You can start the download process from the Data Privacy section of your [Member Settings](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/privacy) and can learn more about how to download your data [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364?hcppcid=search) LinkedIn also provides an [API program](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/dma/member-data-portability/member-data-portability-member) to enable third parties to build integrations with LinkedIn to port data on a Member’s consent in the EEA, EU and Switzerland only. You can find more details in the [Member Portability APIs](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6214075) help centre article.

#### **Withdrawing your consent**

When you give us consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw that consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent via Member settings for certain processing, or by contacting us [here](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fhelp%2Flinkedin%2Fask%2Fppq&data=05%7C02%7Cssundholm%40linkedin.com%7Cda78086e62bc43d9651708dcc759ec40%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C0%7C0%7C638604436264149657%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=KFnKedvcckZE6sfyxXqL%2FjkCdzKxwi%2B5WmejCVGH3Lk%3D&reserved=0). When you withdraw your consent, this won’t affect our use of your data up to that point.

#### **Joint Controller Relationship**

We share insights with entities who have LinkedIn Business Pages on our platform, which include certain Member profile information and interaction data. We are a joint controller with the organisation or legal entity who administers the Business Page for this purpose, and Members can find out more information about LinkedIn’s responsibilities [here](https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum).

#### **Data Retention**

We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalised or aggregated form.   

You can [delete data from your profile or your activity](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1342613) on LinkedIn. If you close your account with LinkedIn, it is closed immediately. However, it may take up to 72 hours for your public profile to be removed from LinkedIn. Search engines like Bing, Google and Yahoo! may still display your information temporarily due to the way they collect and update their search data. Learn more about [how your profile shows up in search engine results](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1376045/). Where we share your data with other third parties, as set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy), e.g. via the LinkedIn Developer Program, they may retain data in accordance with their own retention policies, or in line with our contractual agreements with them.   

For data that LinkedIn collects using cookies, you can see how long LinkedIn processes it for by checking the expiration periods in our [Cookie table](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table). LinkedIn may also collect information about you from cookies on third party websites. For data collected from third party websites where a LinkedIn customer has installed LinkedIn’s tag, LinkedIn de-identifies your personal data after 7 days and permanently deletes it after 180 days.  

There are a number of reasons why we might need to retain some of your data for longer than usual. These may include:

*   Where LinkedIn has suspended your account for inappropriate, harmful or illegal activity that breaches our Professional Community Guidelines and/or we need to resolve complaints relating to your account.
*   Where there is ongoing or potential legal or regulatory proceedings related to your account.
*   Where we are required by law to retain your data. For more information on when we may be required to retain your data for these purposes, see the “**Compliance with Legal Obligations**” section above.  
    

#### **Transfers of your data outside the Designated Countries and the UK** 

LinkedIn may transfer personal data outside of the Designated Countries and the UK as part of its Services e.g. LinkedIn stores personal data on its servers located in the US, so data flows from the EU, EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland to the US, and back. LinkedIn will always use a lawful transfer mechanism to transfer your data outside of the Designated Countries including transfers based on an adequacy decision by an approved authority, standard contractual clauses or, where appropriate, derogations permitted by law.   

LinkedIn is certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and you can find out more information about our participation in the Data Privacy Framework [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1343190).  

LinkedIn also relies on the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of certain personal data from the EU/EEA and Switzerland and on the UK Data Transfer Addendum for certain transfers from the UK. These clauses are contractual commitments between companies (e.g. between LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company and LinkedIn Corporation or suppliers). You can request a copy of LinkedIn’s Standard Contractual clauses [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/ppq).

#### **Contacting your Supervisory Authority**

If you have a concern or complaint about the use of your personal data that you feel has not been addressed by us, you always have the right to raise a concern with the supervisory authority in your jurisdiction.
